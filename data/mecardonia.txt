This low-growing plant blankets  a bed or cascades over the edge of a container. It grows 26 inches  tall and 1218 inches wide. Small, grass-green leaves are topped with clear yellow blooms (1458 inches wide) all season. No deadheading is needed. Heat and drought tolerant. In areas where black- ened by frost, a quick cutback  will make way for the plant to rebound, acting like a root-hardy perennial in the Lower South.  Best known through its hybrids. 'GoldDust' performs better in  the landscape due to more of  a mounding habit than trailing. Reaches 24 inches in height. 'Goldflake' performs in much  of the same way but flowers  later than 'GoldDust'. 'Magic Carpet' has a slightly larger  flower and shows a true trailing habit in a container, reaching  46 inches tall.
