If you think all orchids are hard to grow indoors, you haven't tried this one. Native to the forest floors of Indonesia and Malaysia, jewel orchid is prized more for its foliage than for its flowers. The handsome bronze leaves, up to 3 inches long and 1 inches wide, are streaked with parallel red veins. Creeping stems send up leafy rosettes, each of which produces a foot-tall spike of tiny white flowers in winter.Jewel orchid is best sited in a north- or east-facing window. Shield it from direct midday or afternoon sunlight. Provide well-drained potting soil. Feed every three weeks with a general- purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer diluted to half-strength. Remove flower stalk after blossoms fade. Cut stems are easy to root in water. Outdoors, plant in well-drained soil in a warm, protected spot.
