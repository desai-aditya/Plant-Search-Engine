These Mediterranean natives are carefree shrubs that grow well in limy soils and perform beautifully in dry-summer areas such as Southwest Texas, bloom- ing profusely for a month or more in spring or early summer. They need no fertilizer and very little water; if they will be watered, be sure to provide excellent drainage. Periodically prune out a few of the old stems to keep plants looking neat; tip-pinch young plants to make them bushy.
