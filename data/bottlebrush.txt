Fast-growing plants with colorful flowers carried in dense spikes or round clusters that consist mainly of long, bristlelike stamenshence the common name bottlebrush. Attractive to hummingbirds. Flowers are followed by woody capsules that can last for years and may resemble rows of beads pressed into bark.Some bottlebrushes are naturally dense and compact (making good informal hedges); others are sparse and open (can be pruned up to become small trees). Those with pliant branches can be grown as informal espaliers. Very little routine pruning is neededjust remove any weak or dead branches after bloom or before spring growth. Don't cut into bare wood beyond leaves; if you do, plant may not send out new growth. Generally found in moist ground in their native Australia, bottlebrushes can withstand waterlogged soil. Normally tolerant of saline or alkaline soils but sometimes suffer from chlorosis (yellow leaves with green veins). Often severely damaged at 20F.Variable plant when grown from seed; look for cutting-grown selections with good flower size and color, such as 'Splendens'. Compared to the species, 'Violaceus' ('Jeffersii'), about 6 feet tall and 4 feet wide, has stiffer branches; narrower, shorter leaves; and reddish purple flowers fading to lavender. 'Mauve Mist' is the same but can reach 10 feet.
