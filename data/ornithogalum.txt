Clusters of typically star-shaped flowers appear in spring; Ornithogalum dubium may start blooming in late winter. Leaves vary from narrow to broad and tend to droop. In areas where they are hardy, ornithogalums can fill many different roles. Set them in open woodlands, wild gardens, or rock gardens, where many kinds will naturalize; plant them in containers or mass them in borders. Where winters are too cold for in-ground growing, plant the bulbs in pots and force them into early bloom indoors or in a greenhouse. Deer and rodents don't eat them.Plant bulbs in early fall in well-drained soil amended with plenty of organic matter, setting them 3 inches deep and 34 inches apart. Provide regular moisture during growth and bloom. Dig and divide plantings of all species only when plant vigor and bloom quality decline. Indoors, grow in bright light but protect from hottest summer sun. Let soil dry slightly between thorough soakings, and feed every two weeks with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer. After flowering has ended and leaves begin to yellow, withhold water and fertilizer; don't resume watering and feeding until new growth appears in fall.
