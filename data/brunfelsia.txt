These natives of the American tropics feature clusters of showy flowers during the warmer months. The blossoms are tubular, opening out to flat, round, five-petaled disks; blooms of some species are fragrant, while those of others            change color as they age. In central and south Florida, use in large containers, as specimens, or in shrub borders. Elsewhere, grow in a pot that can be brought indoors to a sunny window for the winter.These are handsome plants that deserve the extra attention they need: grow them in rich, well-drained, slightly acid soil, and give regular feedings throughout the growing season. In alkaline soils, they will develop chlorosis (yellow            leaves with green veins). Prune in spring to remove straggly growth and to shape the plants.
