From Europe; naturalized in U.S. These plants are related to and somewhat resemble hollyhock (Alcea), but they are bushier, with smaller, roundish to heart-shaped leaves. They are easy to grow from seed and usually bloom the first year. Need good drainage, average soil. Use in perennial borders or for a quick tall edging. Not long lived.
