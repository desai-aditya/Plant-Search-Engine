Feather palms with huge, finely divided leaves; leaflets flattened and split at tips like fish tails. Tender. Native to Southeast Asia, where they grow in full sun. Not browsed by deer. In pots indoors, place them near a southern or western window. Let the soil surface go dry to the touch between waterings. Avoid handling fruit with bare hands; invisible crystals inside can cause severe itching and burning.
