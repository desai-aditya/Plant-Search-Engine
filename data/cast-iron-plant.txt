Cast-iron plants were made for brown-thumb gardeners. Sturdy, long-lived, and nearly bulletproof, these evergreen perennials typically form rather open clumps; they tolerate very low light and almost total neglect. Although they don't require well-drained soil enriched with organic matter, they'll be very happy if they get it. If you really want to pamper them, fertilize them occasionally in spring and summer. They make excellent houseplants if placed where they'll get light (45 feet from a sunny, south-facing window, for example). Let the soil surface go dry between waterings. From the Lower South on down, cast-iron plants are also good for deeply shaded areas around the house where few other plants will growunder a deck, for example. Bright, hot sunlight will burn their leaves. Deer resistant.
