Delightful wildflowers native to eastern and central North America. Grown for their hand- some foliage and bell-shaped yellow blooms. Easy to grow in shady places with rich, moist, acid soil. Plants grow about 1 feet wide and spread by rhizomes to form colonies; propagate by division. Good companions to hostas and ferns.
