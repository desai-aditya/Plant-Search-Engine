Slender-stemmed, much-branched plants are upright or spreading, ranging from 3 inches to 4 feet tall. Bloom profusely in summer, covering themselves in clusters of tiny single or double flowers in white, pink, or rose. Leaves (sparse when plants are in bloom) are typically blue green. Use for airy look in borders and bouquets and for contrast with large-flowered, coarse-textured plants. Dwarf kinds are ideal for rock gardens, for trailing from pockets in walls or over tops of dry rock walls.Add lime to strongly acid soils before planting. Perennial kinds are not always easy to transplant (especially Gypsophila paniculata, which has deep, carrot-like roots). If possible, do not disturb them often. Protect roots from gophers; protect tender new growth from snails and slugs. To encourage repeat bloom on perennial sorts, cut back flowering stems before seed clusters form. Perennial species are usually short lived in the Coastal and Tropical South; treat as annuals there.
