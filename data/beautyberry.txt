Graceful, arching shrubs grown for showy fruit. Small lilac or pink flowers in summer are followed by tight clusters of little, round violet-to-purple fruits that last into winter. Effective in woodland gardens or massed in borders. Bloom and fruit occur on current season's growth, so prune in late winter: Remove a third of oldest stems, or lop whole plant low to ground. Plants may freeze to ground in Upper South, but they come back from roots.
