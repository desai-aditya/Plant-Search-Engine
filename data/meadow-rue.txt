Foliage clumps resemble those of columbine (Aquilegia). Plants typically bloom in late spring or summer, sending up sparsely leafed stems topped by puffs of small flowers, each consisting of four sepals and a prominent cluster of stamens. Superb for airy effect; offer a pleasing contrast to sturdier perennials. Delicate tracery of leaves and flowers is particularly effective against dark green background. Foliage is good in arrangements. Most meadow rues need some winter chill; all thrive in dappled sunlight at woodland edges. Protect from wind. Divide clumps every 4 or 5 years. Deer resistant.
