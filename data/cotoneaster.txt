One positive thing about cotoneasters is that many people call them cotton-easters, which is always good for a chuckle. But the party ends there. Except for a few species (noted below), cotoneasters typically look pretty dreadful in the Southern landscape. Prostrate types used for ground covers aren't dense enough to discourage weeds and grass. They mainly serve to snag litter. Young plants can look nice, as white or pinkish springtime flowers give rise to abundant orange or red berries in fall and winter. But susceptibility to spider mites, fireblight, and other pests send these Asian natives downhill fastwhich is ironic, considering that they're favorites for carpeting banks in front of hotels and shopping malls. Taller, arching types perform much better and are worthwhile additions to the home garden.
