These arching shrubs have leathery leaves and clusters of small, urn-shaped white flowers reminiscent of lily-of-the-valley (Convallaria). They need acid, well-drained, woodsy, deep soil; do best in woodland gardens. Best used in masses, since they are not especially attractive individually. Bronze-tinted winter foliage is a bonus. Not easy to grow; short lived in most gardens.The species and its selections take regular water. You can control the plants' height to make a 1 feet ground cover in shade; just cut older, taller stems to ground. Blooming branches make decorative cut flowers. Where summers are hot and humid, various leaf spot diseases can cause serious disfiguration or defoliation.
