Summer-blooming perennials with aromatic foliage and whorls of pink, purple, blue, red, or orange flowers in spikelike clusters. All rebloom if deadheaded. Drought tolerant. Favorites with hummingbirds and butterflies. Species from Mexico and the Southwest need excellent drainage, especially in wet-winter areas.
