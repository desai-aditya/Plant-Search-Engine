Members of the rose family, these small to medium-size, multitrunked trees are well known  for their pretty, typically white flower clusters, which appear after leaf-out in springin fact,  the hawthorn blossom is Missouri's state flower. Showy fruits resembling tiny apples appear in summer and autumn and often hang on into winter. The thorny branches need some pruning to thin out twiggy growth. Hawthorns attract bees and birds but are not usually browsed by deer.These trees will grow in any soil as long as it is well drained. Better grown under somewhat austere conditions, since good soil, regular water, and fertilizer all promote succulent new growth that is most susceptible to reblight. The disease makes entire branches die back quickly; cut out blighted branches well below dead part. The rust stage of cedar-apple rust can be a problem wherever eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) grows nearby. Aphids and scale are widespread potential pests.
