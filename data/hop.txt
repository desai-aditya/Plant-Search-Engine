These fast-growing, twining vines are attractive for summer screening on trellises or arborsand one species yields the hops used in beer. Leaves to 6 inches long are deeply lobed and toothed. Bloom in late summer. Male plants produce flower panicles; females bear blossoms in greenish spikes resembling pinecones. Squarish, hairy stems are set with deeply lobed, toothed leaves to 6 inches long. Stems twine vertically; to get horizontal growth, twine stem tips by hand. Cut stems to ground after frost turns them brown; regrowth comes the following spring.
