The most stately and varied of bulbous plants, offering large, colorful, and often fragrant blooms equally effective in the garden or vase. For many years, only the speciesthe same plants growing wild in parts of Asia, Europe, and North Americawere available, and many of these were difficult and unpredictable. Around 1925, however, lily growers began a significant breeding program. They bred new hybrids, strains, and selections that were healthier, hardier, and easier to grow than the original species. Today, hybrids and strains are typically the best garden lilies, but it is still possible to get some desirable species.Although the official classification of lilies lists eight divisions of hybrids and a ninth division of species, the following listings describe the lilies commonly available to Southern gardeners. Advances in breeding are producing lilies with forms, colors, and parentage hitherto considered unlikely, if not impossible. Consult specialists' catalogs to learn about these wonders, which are reaching the market faster than books can deal with them.Formosa lily is often confused with a similar but lower-growing lily that also grows well in the South, Lilium philippinense. The resulting hybrids, called Philippine lilies, retain the look and growth habit of Lilium formosanum but are more floriferous.
