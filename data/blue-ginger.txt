This Brazilian native is not a true ginger but rather a robust and upright-growing relative of wandering Jew (Tradescantia). Succulent, unbranched or sparsely branched stems rise from a short, fleshy rhizome and reach 68 feet tall. Deep green, oval, 6- to 12 inches-long, evergreen leaves are spirally arranged around the stem, forming a 3 feet-wide foliage clump. Deep violet-blue flowers appear in 6 inches spikes at tops of stems throughout the year. Best in moist soil enriched with organic matter. Easy to propagate by cuttings. As a houseplant or in greenhouse, grows 3 feet tall in an 8 inches pot, taller in a large container. Weeping blue ginger (D. pendula) is similar but has drooping clusters of blue flowers.
