These plants and their big leaves come from the streamsides and marshes of tropical Asia and bring a lush look to gardens. Many fancy-leafed selections have been introduced recently, and more are sure to follow. They can be grown indoors in bright light or outdoors in filtered sunlight. Give them moist, well-drained soil containing lots of organic matter. Provide shelter from wind so leaves don't get tattered. The flowers are like those of calla (Zantedeschia)a spikelike structure (spadix) surrounded by a fleshy, hoodlike bract (spathe). Flowers are followed by reddish fruit, giving spike the look of corn on the cob. Although useful in garden beds and containers, most are sensitive to frost.
