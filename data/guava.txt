Native to tropical America, guavas (botanical name Psidium) are prized for their tasty fruit. They are resilient plants, easy to grow along the Gulf Coast and in South Texas and Florida; in fact, they have escaped cultivation and become invasive in some areas of Florida. Fruit generally ripens in sum- mer and fall, but some selections ripen fruit nearly year-round. Each guava weighs up to a pound and may be round, oval, or pear-shaped. Skin is usually yellow; flesh may be white, yellow, pink, or red and often contains small seeds (fully edible in most selections). Fruit is rich in potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin Cin fact, the fruit of some selections has five times the vitamin C of an orange. Trees are self-fruitful but bear more heavily if cross-pollinated with another selection. Fruit ripens better on the tree but can be picked green and ripened at room temperature; when ready to eat, it emits a sweet, pungent odor and is soft to the touch.Recommended selections include these five:Common guava tolerates most soils but grows best in those with a pH between 5 and 7. Withstands temporary flooding and seasonal drought, but not salt. Responds well to fertilizer: Feed monthly during the growing season with 8-4-8 fertilizer, following package directions. For good fruit production in areas with limestone soils, applications of iron chelate or iron sulfate may be necessary. Common pests in Florida include nematode, guava whitefly, Caribbean fruit fly, and guava moth. Consult your local Cooperative Extension Office for best methods of control. Young trees may be killed by frost, but older trees are hardy to about 29F; if frozen to the ground, they usually resprout and bear fruit within 2 years.
