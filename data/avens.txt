This group of plants combines handsome foliage with showy flowers. Double, semidouble,  or single blossoms in red, orange, pink, or yellow appear through- out the summer if plants are deadheaded regularly; they  make good cut flowers. Leaves  of most are divided into many leaflets, often with scalloped or toothed margins. Geums are not suited to extended summer heat. They'll grow in the Middle South, but they prefer the Upper South and higher elevations of the Appalachians, Blue Ridge Mountains, and Ozarks. Soil should be consistently moist  and, except for Geum rivale, well drained. Start from seed sown  in early spring, or set out transplants. Divide established plants in fall or spring. Deer resistant.
