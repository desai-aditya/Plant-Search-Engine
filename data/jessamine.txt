These fast-growing, twining vines are beloved for their showy yellow flowers. They'll quickly cover a lamppost, trellis, or arbor, but their thin, twining stems won't damage the support. May be semievergreen in the Middle South. Deer usually leave them alone.Prefers fertile soil but adapts to almost any well-drained soil. Needs regular water in youth but is very drought tolerant once established. Blooms better in sun but tolerates partial shade. Often seen scrambling companionably through tree branches in the wild. In gardens, it's a favorite choice for climbing over mailboxes; also excellent for training above doorways and bay windows, along fences and walls. May be used as a ground cover on banks; keep trimmed to 3 feet high. Some- times gets too heavy on top and bare around the base; if this happens, cut back severely after bloom.
