The three hardier species are native to cold-winter regions of Europe and Asia and need some winter chill. Gardeners in cold-winter climates know them as harbingers of spring; the earliest ones come into flower with winter aconite (Eranthis) and snowdrop (Galanthus). Less hardy to cold is Peruvian scilla (Scilla peruviana); despite its name, it is native to the Mediterranean region. All squills have bell-shaped or starlike flowers borne on leafless stems that rise from clumps of strap- shaped leaves.Cold-hardy species look best when naturalized; grow them in small patches or larger drifts. Scilla peruviana is most attractive in clumps along pathways, at edges of mixed plantings, in pots. Deer seem to avoid all species.Plant all types in fall, in well-drained, organically enriched soil. Set bulbs of cold-hardy species 23 inches deep, 4 inches apart; set those of Scilla peruviana 34 inches deep, 6 inches apart. Reduce watering when foliage yellows after bloom. Hardy kinds will tolerate less moisture during summer dormancy, but don't let soil dry out completely. Scilla peruviana will accept summer moisture but doesn't need any. Divide clumps (during dormancy) when vigor and bloom quality decline.
