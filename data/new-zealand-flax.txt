From New Zealand, these dramatic plants have many swordlike evergreen leaves that grow in a fan pattern; they're good massed or used as focal points. Many variegated selections provide year-round color in perennial and shrub borders, on hillsides, in seaside plantings, near swimming pools. Cool weather intensifies foliage colors. On established plants, branched clusters of tubular flowers appear in late spring or early summer, rising to twice the height of the foliage clump in some kinds. Hummingbirds love the flowers.Rugged New Zealand flax, Phormium tenax, and its selections are sturdy and fast growing. While most phormiums dislike humid summers and cold winters, New Zealand flax accepts the Southern climate. It takes almost any soil and tolerates drought and coastal conditions; good drainage, how- ever, is essential to success. Grow in containers wherever soil doesn't freeze in winter.More finicky than Phormium tenax are forms of Phormium cookianium and the spectacular hybrids between these two species. They require a bit more water; in hot areas, their arching leaves need afternoon shade to prevent burning.All phormiums are harmed by temperatures below 20F. In cold-winter areas, you can grow smaller sorts indoors or move larger containers to shelter when deep cold threatens.Nursery plants in containers are deceptively small; when you plant, allow enough room to accommodate a mature specimen. Cut out flower stalks when blossoms wither. As leaves age, colors fade; cut out older (outer) ones as close to base as possible to maintain best appearance. On variegated sorts, watch for reversions to solid green or bronze; remove reverted crowns down to root level before they take over the clump. Clumps can remain in place indefinitely. To increase plantings, take individual crowns from clump edges; or divide large clumps (not an easy job).
