Grown for white or cream- colored, usually fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Blossoms are four petaled, typically 12 inches wide; they range from single to fully double and may be borne singly or in clusters, depending on species. Mock oranges are generally large and vigorous, with fountainlike form. Oval, 2- to 4 inches-long leaves (typically medium green in color) are arranged in pairs along the stems.Prune every year just after bloom, cutting out oldest wood and surplus shoots at base. To rejuvenate, cut to the ground after bloom. Taller types are striking planted in lawns and as background and corner plantings; smaller kinds can be planted near foundations or used as low screens or informal hedges. Buy plants in bloom to check for best fragrance. Not fussy about soil type but must have good drainage.
