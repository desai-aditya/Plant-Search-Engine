These dependable shrubs are among the best plants for the beach (they tolerate wind and salt spray), but they have many other uses as well. Their glossy, leathery leaves and compact form make them good subjects for foundation plantings, berms, low hedges, and containers.  They bloom profusely from fall  or midwinter until late spring, with flowers ranging in color from white through pink to nearly red. Berrylike dark blue fruit (not especially showy) follows the blossoms. Emerging leaves are tinged bronze and red.Most stay low. The taller  kinds seldom reach more than 56 feet., and pruning can keep them at 3 feet almost indefinitely. For bushy, compact plants, pinch back branch tips at least once yearly, after flowering. Tolerate drought; need good drainage. Plants growing in partial shade are less compact and have fewer flowers than those growing in full sun.Selections include the  following.
