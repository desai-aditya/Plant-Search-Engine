Small spring flowers aren't showy when viewed casually, but they're attractive at close range.For best growth, give well-drained soil amended with plenty of organic matter. Set 6 inches apart for reasonably quick cover; apply a mulch, and keep soil moist until plants are established. Give them light to full shade; too much sun causes foliage to turn yellow.
