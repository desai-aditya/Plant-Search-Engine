Growing in graceful, fountainlike mounds, these are among the most foolproof grasses for the South. They have long, narrow leaves and arching stems that bear furry, foxtail-like plumes. Bloom begins in summer and often extends into fall. Excellent in containers, in mixed borders, as dramatic sweeps, and for bank covers. Cut back perennial types to within a few inches of the ground in late winter for fresh new growth in spring. Resist deer.
