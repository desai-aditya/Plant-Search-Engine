Sterling group of cold-hardy fan palms, unsurpassed for their versatility, adaptability, and ease of culture. They tolerate almost any soil and thrive in sun or light shade; they'll even take salt spray. Some have trunks, while others do not; all grow rather slowly. Tree types make excellent street, lawn, and shade trees; shrubby sorts are useful in understory plantings and naturalized areas. Mature plants bear large clusters of tiny flowers among the leaves, typically in summer.
