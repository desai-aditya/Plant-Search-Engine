The genus Cassia once included many yellow-flowered trees and shrubs now reclassified as Senna (see that entry), though some are still sold under their old names. These cassias are showy flowering trees that brighten landscapes in the warmest climatesnot just with yellow blossoms but also with pink, cerise, and white ones. Flowering times are approximate, since plants may bloom at any time or bloom intermittently over a long period. Most have long seedpods that can present a litter problem. Grow in well-drained soil. Plants are best pruned when young (to develop a strong framework) and as needed after flowering is finished. Rarely browsed by deer.Several named selections are available in a range of flower colors from pale yellow through golden yellow to orange and cerisethe rainbow of the common name. Some may produce occasional seedpods.
