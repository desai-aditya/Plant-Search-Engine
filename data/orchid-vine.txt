Vines of Mexican origin that bloom during the hottest time  of year. Bright green leaves in opposite pairs look like those  of honeysuckle (Lonicera). Clusters of five-petaled, 1 inches blooms centered with ten stamens; petals are shaped  like Ping-Pong paddles. Oddly winged seedpods look some- thing like butterflies and  are sometimes used in dried arrangements.
