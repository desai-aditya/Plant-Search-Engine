Himalayan native growing to  2 inches high, spreading 1 feet or wider by slender stems that creep and root along the ground. Small, sparsely toothed, rather narrow leaves are bright green. Spring and early-summer flowers are  34 inches across, purplish blue with white and yellow markings; they appear in clusters of two to five. In shape, the blossoms resemble those of monkey flower (Mimulus).  Use in a rock garden, as a small- scale ground cover, or as a filler between pavers (it takes heavy foot traffic in this last role). Needs rich soil. Evergreen in mild-winter climates; in colder areas, freezes to ground but usually recovers quickly in spring if protected  over winter by snow cover or  light mulch. Give full sun or  partial shade in Upper and Middle South, partial to full shade in Lower South. A white-blossomed form is available, sold  by some nurseries as M. reptans 'Albus' and by others as M. japonicus 'Albiflorus'.
