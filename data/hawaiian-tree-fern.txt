These evergreen ferns are superb for creating tropical effects. A solitary brown trunk the upper portion of which is thickly covered with silky hairs supports arching, intricately divided, feathery-looking fronds. Provide reasonably fertile, well-drained soil and shelter from strong winds. Prune to remove old or injured fronds. The two Hawaiian natives listed here are hardy to 30F; beyond their hardiness range, they can be grown in a large greenhouse or sunroom in bright light.
