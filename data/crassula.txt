This interesting group of succu- lents, mostly from South Africa, includes many plants with unusual geometric forms. Excellent drainage is a must be careful not to overwater.  Most prefer full sun, but a few tolerate shade. All make excellent houseplants. Gardeners in the Tropical South can use them outdoors in containers, rock gardens, and borders.
