Richly colored tropical plants, some with flower clusters in bizarre shapes. In cut arrangements, celosias are attractive with other flowers, but in gardens they are most effective by themselves. Dry cut blooms for winter bouquets. Sow seed in place in late spring or early -summer, or set out started plants. Plants will bloom by summer.The other celosia group is the crested cockscombs (often sold as Celosia 'Cristata'). These have velvety, fan-shaped flower clusters, often much contorted and fluted. Flowers are yellow, orange, crimson, purple, or red. Tall kinds grow to 3 feet tall and 112 feet wide, dwarf selections to 10 inches high and 6 inches wide. Crested cockscombs perform much better in the South than plume cockscombs.
