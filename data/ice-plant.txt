Along with a few other genera, these low-growing succulents are all known as ice plants. Delosperma species, most of which hail from South Africa, are the best ice plants for the South (they do particularly well in the Southwest). They never grow more than a few inches high but spread to form ground-hugging mats ideal for covering a bank or slope. Daisylike flowers (about 2 inches across) appear above the small, succulent leaves, which may be cylindrical or flattened. Need full sun, good drainage, and just enough water to keep them looking fresh. Mulch with gravel to keep base of plant dry. Withhold water in fall to harden off plants for winter.
