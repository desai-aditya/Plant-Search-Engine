Curious rather than beautiful relatives of calla (Zantedeschia), attractive both to children and to fanciers of the unusual. Flowers are tiny, crowded on a club- shaped spadix surrounded by an overarching, typically green or dull purple spathe (flower bract) that is often striped in a contrasting color. In late spring, tubers send up one to three leaves, each divided into three or more leaflets. Inflorescences appear on a separate stalk in spring or early summer. As the flowers fade, the spathe withers and the spadix forms orange to red seeds.These are woodland plants, appreciative of organic material in the soil. Plant in fall, setting tubers 1 feet apart, 2 inches deep. Plants die to the ground in winter; don't let dormant tubers dry out completely. Species other than those listed below may appear from time to time in specialists' catalogs.
