Offering some of the richest blues in the garden, these delightful, refined plants are considered by many to be difficult customersand some of the rock-garden types are indeed pretty finicky. All of the species listed here, however, are easy to grow if planted in moist, acid soil enriched with plenty of organic matter. Most are best suited to the Upper and Middle South and the higher elevations of the Appalachians, Blue Ridge Mountains, and Ozarks, but some can also be grown as far south as Mississippi and Alabama. Do not disturb plants once they're established.
