This choice perennial from Japan is one of the few ornamental grasses that thrive in shade. Clumps of narrow, gracefully arching leaves grow 13 feet tall; they spread somewhat wider by underground runners but advance slowly and are not invasive. Delicate sprays of flowers among the leaves in mid- to late summer are attractive but not showy. Whole plant turns an attractive buff color in winter. Good candidate for rock gardens, patio containers. The species has solid green leaves that turn coppery orange in fall, but most gardeners plant types with variegated leaves to bring summer color to shade gardens. Try them in combination with evergreens with dark green foliage, such as rhododendron, camellia, Japanese black pine (Pinus thunbergii), or green-leafed Japanese aucuba. Plant in spring in rich, moist, well-drained soil. Does not like drought or root competition. Deer resistant.
