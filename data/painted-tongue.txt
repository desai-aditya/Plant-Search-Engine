Native to South America. Upright, open habit to 23 feet tall, 1 feet wide. Stems and narrow, 4 inches-long leaves are sticky. Flowers are 2212 inches wide; resemble petunias in shape but offer more unusual colorsmahogany-red, reddish orange, yellow, purple, deep blue, and pink shades, marbled and penciled with contrasting colors. Plants bloom most heavily in late spring and early summer. Good background plant for border; handsome cut flower. 'Kew Blue' is an excellent blue with a deep purple throat. Bolero (to 2 feet tall), Stained Glass (18 inches.), and Royale (1216 inches.) are compact strains.Seeds are rather difficult to start, especially when sown directly in garden. A better way to start them is to plant in potting mix in peat pots, several seeds to a pot. Keep pots in a warm, protected location; thin seedlings to one per pot. In most areas, plant seeds in late winter, then set out young plants once they're well established and all danger of frost is past. In Florida and South Texas, sow seeds in early fall and grow plants for winter and spring bloom. Performs best in rich soil. Stake tall types. Tip-pinch growing plants to induce branching.
