These plants are valued primarily for their foliage and form, though they also bear clusters of small, bell-shaped, sweetly fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by fairly conspicuous fruit the size of large peas. They are basic, dependable plants with pleasing outlines when allowed to branch naturally. Prune periodically to enhance form, thinning out weak branches and wayward shoots. They make good clipped hedges. Excellent for screens, windbreaks. Susceptible to aphids and scale; sooty mold on leaves is a sign of infestation. Ripe fruit (yellowish or orange) splits open to reveal sticky seeds; fallen fruit can be a nuisance on lawns and paving.
