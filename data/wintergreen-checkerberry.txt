Native to eastern North America, this handsome, low-growing shrub is the source of oil of wintergreen. Creeping stems send up erect stems to 6 inches high, with oval, 2 inches-long, glossy dark green leaves clustered near their tips. Foliage emits a strong wintergreen odor when bruised, turns reddish in winter. Small, pinkish white summer flowers are followed by scarlet berries. Ideal as ground cover for a partly shaded rock garden or a woodland garden. Space plants 1 feet apart in acid, well-drained soil containing plenty of organic matter; wintergreen will not survive in clay soil. It performs best in the Upper South and higher elevations of the Appa- lachian and Blue Ridge Mountains. 'Very Berry' is more compact than the species and bears a very heavy crop of berries.
