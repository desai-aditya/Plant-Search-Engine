These small, delicate-flowered members of the ginger family are native to Southeast Asia. They grow upright to 13 feet tall; leaves are lustrous green sheaths, and graceful, spidery flowers bloom in summer or fall among long, arching sprays of brightly colored bracts. Bulbils are often found inside the bracts and if planted promptly will produce new plants. Space 112 feet apart. Easy to grow if fertilized and kept moist during the growing season and fed with a balanced controlled-release fertilizer in early spring and again in midsummer. In cold-winter areas, bring indoors before frost; mist to provide humidity if necessary, and stop watering during the winter to give plant a period of dormancy. Resume watering gradually in spring. Most make good cut flowers.
