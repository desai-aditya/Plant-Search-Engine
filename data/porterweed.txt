Group of shrubby perennials native to New and Old World tropics and treasured for their flowers. Bloom continuously in warm weather, with long, whiplike spikes bearing clusters of small, showy blossoms that attract butterflies and hummingbirds. Effective in naturalized areas, in mixed herbaceous borders, and when massed. Plants self-sow readily and can be weedy.
