In the wild, these cacti live on trees, as epiphytic orchids do. In the home, they are dependable, easy, long-lived houseplants. Plants are often confused with Zygocactus. The many kinds differ principally in flower color.Plant in well-drained soil. Feed with liquid fertilizer every 7-10 days during active growth and bloom. Keep soil moist from time flower buds appear to after blooms finish. Then let soil go somewhat dry between waterings. Like poinsettias, Christmas and Thanksgiving cacti need long nights and short days to initiate floweringat least 14 hours of complete darkness per day.
