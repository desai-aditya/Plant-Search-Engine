Irislike plants with fans of stiff, narrow, evergreen leaves; form dense, long-lasting clumps. Flowers resembling small Japanese irises consist of three outer and three inner segments; they appear on branched  stalks throughout spring, summer, and fall, and sometimes well into winter in mild climates. Bloom bursts seem to occur at 2-week intervals, hence the common name fortnight lily. Flowers come in solid colorswhite, cream, yellow; each of the three outer segments features  a small contrasting blotch of orange, yellow, or brown. Each flower lasts only a day, but the supply of flowers on a stem is seemingly endless. Excellent in permanent landscape plantings with pebbles and rocks, shrubs, and other long-lived perennials.Plant from containers at any  time of year, setting plants 23 feet apart. All types look best with good soil and regular moisture, but once established they perform satisfactorily even in poor soil or with infrequent or erratic watering. Clumps can remain undisturbed for years; when  you need to divide, do so in fall or winter.
