Native to Argentina, this tough- as-nails amaryllis relative was introduced into the Texas  Hill Country by German settlers  in the 1850s. Narrow, foot-long leaves emerge in fall, persist through winter and spring, and then die down. In August or September, following a rain, clusters of blood-red, 2 inches-long flowers appear atop leafless foot-tall stalks.Set bulbs out in spring, planting them 4 inches deep, 1 feet apart. The plant multiplies naturally  in just about any well-drained soil. It likes moisture during winter and spring but needs no water  in summer. An old Southern favorite and a popular passalong plant. 'Hill Country Red' is a  clone of the  old Texas heirloom strain.
