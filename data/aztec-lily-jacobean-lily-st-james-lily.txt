Mexican native often sold as Amaryllis formosissima. Foliage looks like that of daffodil (Narcissus), but each 1 feet-tall stem is topped with a dark red, 6 inches-wide bloom resembling an orchid, with three erect upper segments and three drooping lower ones that are united at their bases (near the flower's center) to form a tube. Bloom comes primarily in spring, with a second bloom in fall. In mild climates, foliage may be evergreen and plant may bloom several times a year if you can give it a dry period after flowering, then resume regular watering to trigger a new growth cycle. Not damaged by deer or rodents.Where bulbs are hardy, plant them in fall, setting them 34 inches deep and 8 inches apart in good, well-drained soil. Look most effective in groups. Display increases if plants are left undisturbed for several years. Where winters are cold, set out bulbs in spring; lift plants in fall when foliage yellows, and store in a cool, dark, dry place over winter (leave dry tops on). Or grow in pots as directed for amaryllis (Hippeastrum); repot every three or four years.
