Among the easier ferns to grow. Deciduous in most areas, they thrive in moist, organic soil but will tolerate some drought if soil is rich. They take more sun than most ferns, provided moisture is plentiful. Effective in masses or combined with plants having coarser leaves. All spread by rhizomes to form colonies.
