This group includes a number of perennials, mostly native to tropical forests of South America. All are grown for their colorful, showy, solitary or clustered flowers in the shape of tubes, trumpets, or bells. These plants require well-drained soil.Gloxinias need constant warmth and are most often grown in a greenhouse or as houseplants, though they can be taken outdoors in warm weather. Tubers are usually available in winter or spring. For each tuber, choose a container big enough to leave 2 inches between all sides of tuber and container edges. Fill with a mix of equal parts peat moss, perlite, and leaf mold or compost; set tuber 12 inches deep. Place in a warm spot (about 72F during day, no cooler than 65F at night) with plenty of bright light but no direct sun. Water sparingly until first leaves appear, then increase watering as roots and leaves grow. Apply water to soil only, or pour it into a saucer to be absorbed through pot's drainage holes (pour off any water left unabsorbed after an hour). Feed with a general- purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer diluted to half-strength; start feeding when leaves emerge, then feed every two weeks until flowers fade. After bloom has finished, gradually dry off plants. When leaves have died down completely, move container to dark place where temperatures remain around 60F. Mist soil just enough to keep tubers from shriveling. When tubers show signs of resuming growth in midwinter, repot in fresh soil mix. If roots have filled container, move tuber to a larger pot.
