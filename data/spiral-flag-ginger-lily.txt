Plants in this genus are related to true gingers (Zingiber) and other so-called gingers (Alpinia, Hedychium), and like them have eshy rhizomes and stems bearing large leaves. In Costus, the leaves are spirally arranged around the stem. Flowers emerge from a tight, conelike cluster of colored bracts at stem ends in summer and fall.Plants have sprawling, mounding habit. Native to the tropical forest oor, they prefer light shade but can stand full sun if roots are shaded. Use around foundation or near patio or pool; can also be grown in large pots. Plants are dormant in winter and need little water at that time. Provide a winter mulch.
