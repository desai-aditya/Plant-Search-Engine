Native to India and tropical Asia, these old Southern favorites combine handsome foliage with showy, often deliciously fragrant flowers. Rich green, alternate leaves ascend stems growing from stout rhizomes. In late summer or early fall, blossoms in dense spikes open from cones of overlapping bracts at the ends of stalks. Plants are evergreen in the Tropical South, deciduous elsewhere. Use them in borders or grow in containers. Southern specialty growers offer dozens of species and selections in heights from 29 feet., in colors ranging from white and cream through pink to redand a host of yellow, orange, and salmon shades.Ginger lilies need moist, well-drained soil that contains lots of organic matter. Cutting back old stems after the flowers fade encourages new growth. Propagate by division in late fall or early spring.
