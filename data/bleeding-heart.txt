Graceful, fernlike foliage. Leafless stems carry dainty, pendent flowers, usually heart shaped  and  to 1 inches long, in pink, rose, yellow, or white. Combine handsomely with ferns, hostas, astilbes, epimediums, foam- flowers (Tiarella), hellebores.  In general, they need rich, light, moist, porous soil. Never let water stand around roots.
