Iris relatives with narrow, grasslike leaves and small, six-segmented flowers that open in sunshine. The blossoms are pretty up close but not showy from a distance. Best suited for informal gardens or naturalizing; small types are good in rock gardens. Easy to start from seed; will self-sow. Not usually browsed by deer.
