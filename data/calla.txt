Native to South Africa. Basal clumps of long-stalked, shiny, rich green, arrow- or lance-shaped leaves, sometimes spotted white. Flower bract (spathe) surrounds central spike (spadix) that is tightly covered with tiny true flowers. Deer usually leave callas alone.Common calla (Zantedeschia aethiopica) is basically evergreen but goes partly dormant even in the Tropical South. It will thrive in almost any moist, even boggy soil all year. It cannot withstand storage and so should be grown as a container plant where winter temperatures fall below 10F.The other callas described here die to the ground yearly in fall and reappear in spring. They need slightly acid soil and regular water during growth and bloom, followed by a resting period in which, ideally, water is withheld. In rainy climates, rhizomes will tolerate moisture if soil is well drained. Store potted rhizomes dry in their containers. Beyond their hardiness range, rhizomes of deciduous species can be dug and stored over winter, then replanted in spring.Where callas are hardy, plant all types in fall, setting rhizomes of Zantedeschia aethiopica 46 inches deep, those of other species 2 inches deep. Space rhizomes 812 inches apart. Leave undisturbed until overcrowding causes a decline in vigor and bloom quality. Elsewhere, plant rhizomes in spring and lift them in fall.
