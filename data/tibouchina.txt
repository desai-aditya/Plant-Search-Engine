Brazilian natives with deeply veined, oval, pointed leaves and big, showy, five-petaled flowers in various shades of purple. Bloom is intermittent over a long period. These plants prefer rich, well- drained, slightly acid soil; a thick layer of mulch helps keep the roots cool. They have a tendency to legginess and should be pruned lightly after every bloom cycle, somewhat more heavily in spring; resprout quickly after heavy pruning. Pinch tips of young plants to encourage bushiness. Somewhat resistant to deer damage.
