From northern China and Korea. Distantly related to citrus, but the shiny, dark green leaves are more reminiscent of walnut (Juglans): 1216 inches long, each with five pairs of 2- to 5 inches-long, pointed-oval leaflets plus a single leaflet at the end. Quickly grows to 3050 feet tall and wide. Foliage is handsome throughout summer and early fall; in autumn, it may turn yellow or simply drop from the branches while still green. Blooms in early summer, bearing showy, 4- to 6 inches-long, rather flat clusters of small white flowers that are very popular with bees. Fruit is small but eye catching because of its numbers; it ages from red to black. Although the plant was introduced nearly a century ago, it remains little known, despite  its good looks, soil tolerance,  and freedom from pests. Casts  light shade, making it a good specimen tree for a lawn. Formerly known as Evodia daniellii.
