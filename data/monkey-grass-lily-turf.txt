Forming tufts of grasslike leaves, these popular, tough-as-nails ground covers from Asia are known by a number of namesbut to most Southerners, they're plain old monkey grass. One species grows in clumps; the other spreads aggressively. Summer flowers, often quite showy, appear atop the foliage in spikes or branching clusters and come in lavender, blue, pink, purple, or white.In addition to their use as a ground cover, these plants make excellent edgings for walks and planting beds. They're good beneath large trees, as they tolerate the shallow soil between surface roots. They also make nice additions to containers and mixed plantings. They generally prefer filtered sun to full shade, although some selections do well in full sun. Good drainage is important; regular fertilizing isn't necessary. To get more plants, divide in early spring, using a sharp spade to cut through the clumps. Deer don't usually eat the foliage.Liriope's close cousin, Ophiopogon japonicus, is also called monkey grass. It has many of the same uses but is less cold hardy. See page 460.
