These delightful, well-behaved shrubs merit a place in practically every garden. Having one or more on display earns you instant respect from the gardening cognoscenti. Although some daphnes are easier to grow than others, all require excellent drain- age, cool soil (accomplished with mulch and light afternoon shade), occasional watering during summer dry spells, and protection from hot sun and heavy winds. Plants respond well to pruning but rarely need more than an occa- sional snip to correct their shape cut back to lateral branches or just above a growth bud. Cut branches  can be forced into early bloom indoors in winter. Daphnes are not browsed by deer.Selections include 'Eximia', lower than the species (to 8 inches high) and with larger flowers; Daphne c. pygmaea 'Alba', 3 inches tall, 1 feet wide, with white flowers; 'Ruby Glow', with larger, more deeply colored flowers than those of the species and with late-summer rebloom; and 'Variegata', with attractive gold-edged leaves.The following are among the selections available.This species needs much air around its roots, so plant in porous soil (as you would rhododendrons). Always set plant a bit high, so the juncture of roots and stems is 12 inches above soil grade. Where soil is heavy and poorly drained, grow in porous, organic soil mixture in raised bed or  container. Transplanting is risky, so choose site carefully.Plant this daphne where it can get at least 3 hours of shade each day around midday. If possible, shade soil around roots with living ground cover. A soil pH of 6.0-7.0 is right for it. Feed right after bloom with complete fertilizer (but not with acid plant food).
