Fairly fast-growing plants, well adapted to hot, dry regions. Leaves are divided like feathers into many roundish leaflets. Clusters of white or pink, sweet peashaped flowers bloom from midspring to early summer, followed by beanlike pods about 4 inches long. Locust trees tolerate poor soil and can get by on little or no water, but they do have some drawbacks: Wood is brittle, roots are aggressive, and plants often spread by suckers.Black locust is little valued in its native territory, but it is a favorite in Europe. Rot-resistant wood is sought after for fence posts. Bees make delicious honey from the nectar of its flowers. The tree manufactures its own fertilizer through nitrogen-fixing root nodule bacteria and can colonize the poorest soil. Given some pruning and training in its early years, it can be a truly handsome flowering tree, but locust borer limits its usefulness in many regions; locust leaf miner is also a damaging pest, especially in the Upper and Middle South.Often used as street tree, but not good in space between sidewalk and curb or under power lines. Wood is extremely hard; suckers are difficult to prune out where not wanted.Recommended selections include the following.
