The hallmark of these fast-growing plants is their exotic leaves, which are divided into leaflets that spread out like the fingers of a hand. In most of the South, they are popular houseplants. They prefer bright light but need protection from direct sun, which may burn leaves. Give good drainage; let the soil go fairly dry between soakings. Feed once a month with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer; stop feeding and reduce watering in fall and winter. Watch for mealybugs, red spider mites, aphids, and scale; apply insecticidal soap or horticultural oil to control these pests. Dust-free, well-humidified plants suffer the fewest problems, so frequent misting is a good idea.Outdoors, plant scheffleras in fertile, well-drained soil, either in the ground or in large pots. In central and south Florida, they grow into small trees. Bold texture makes them useful accents for patios and Florida rooms. Summer flowers (showy in some species) are followed by tiny dark fruit; houseplants are unlikely to bloom.
