About 40 species of tropical trees and shrubs. Although they're hardy outdoors in the Tropical South, most people grow them indoors. Some species and selections display graceful, fountainlike forms with broad, curved, ribbonlike leaves that may be striped with chartreuse  or white; others bear stiff, sword- like foliage.Dracaenas are popular houseplants because they look good even if neglected or grown in low light. Let soil dry to a depth of   inches between waterings; overwatering results in leaves that are yellowed or spotted with brown. In spring and summer, feed twice monthly with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer; don't feed at all in fall and winter. If stems get leggy, cut them back to just above a node; new shoots will sprout. Watch out for spider mites. Outdoors, all but Dracaena draco need protection from sweeping winds. For other plants often called dracaena, see Cordyline.
