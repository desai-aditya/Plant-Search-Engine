Three species of these popular flowers were formerly listed under Chrysanthemum.Some of the selections available in garden centers include: 'Esther Read', most popular double white, long bloom; 'Marconi', large, frilly double; 'Aglaya', similar to 'Marconi', long blooming season; 'Wirral Supreme', double white with short white central petals; 'Alaska', big, old-fashioned single; 'Horace Read', 4 inches-wide dahlialike flower; 'Majestic', large, yellow-centered, single flower; 'Thomas Killin' ('T. E. Killin'), 6 inches-wide (largest), yellow-centered, double flower. 'Becky', a tall single selection with sturdy stems, is a popular Southern passalong plant known by several names, including 'July daisy,' 'Ryan's daisy,' and 'Becky's daisy.' 'Cobham's Gold' has distinctive flowers in a yellow-tinted, off-white shade. 'Canarybird', another yellow-toned selection, is a dwarf with attractive dark green foliage. Most popular selections for cut flowers are 'Esther Read', 'Majestic', 'Aglaya', and 'Thomas Killin'.Shasta daisies are easy to grow from seed. Catalogs offer many strains, including Diener's Strain (double) and Roggli Super Giant (single). 'Marconi' (double), also available in seed, nearly always blooms double. 'Silver Princess' ('Little Princess', 'Little Miss Muffet') is a 12- to 15 inches dwarf single. 'Snow Lady' (single), an All-America winner, 1012 inches tall, begins to bloom in 5 months from seed, then blooms nearly continuously.Set out divisions of Shasta daisies in fall or early spring; set out container-grown plants any time. These plants thrive in fairly rich, moist, well-drained soil. Prefer sun but do well in partial shade in Lower and Coastal South; double-flowered kinds hold up better in very light shade in all zones. Divide clumps every 2 or 3 years in early spring (or in fall in Lower and Coastal South). Shasta daisies are generally easy to grow but have a few problems. Gall disease causes the crown to split into many weak, poorly rooted growing points that soon die. Dig out and dispose of afflicted plants; don't replant Shasta daisies in the same spot.
