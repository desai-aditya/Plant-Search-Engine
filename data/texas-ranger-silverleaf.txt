Native to the Southwest and northern Mexico, these compact, slow-growing shrubs are highly useful and attractive in dry gardens. Most have silvery foli- age and a good show of - to 1 inches-wide flowers with an open bell shape. Flowering may occur at varying times of the year, often after summer showers. In fact, they can bloom in response to increased humidity, flowering a few days before rain and earning them the nickname barometer bush. Need very good drainage. Tolerate heat, wind, and alkaline soil. Resist damage from browsing deer. Use as informal or clipped hedges, massed as tall ground cover, or in mixed dry-country gardens. Unless formally hedged, plants require little pruning. Old, leggy plants can be rejuvenated by cutting close to the ground.
