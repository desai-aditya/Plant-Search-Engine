Native to Texas and Louisiana. Airy plant growing to 14 feet high, 23 feet wide. Stalkless leaves to 112312 inches long grow directly on stems. Long bloom period (often from late spring into fall). Pink buds closely set on branching spikes open just a few at a time; blossoms are about 1 inches long, white aging to rose. Used widely in most of the South. Performs best in the Southwest, where it is a profusely blooming, long-lived perennial. Taproot makes it very drought tolerant.Selected forms include the following.Plant prefers lean, unfertilized soil; planting in rich soil results in legginess and sparse bloom. Faded flowers drop cleanly from stems, but seed-bearing spikes should be cut to improve appearance, prevent overly enthusiastic self-sowing, and prolong bloom.Needs good drainage. Clumps never need dividing; for addi- tional plants, allow some of the volunteer seedlings to grow.
