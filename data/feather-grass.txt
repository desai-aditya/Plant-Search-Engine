These clump-forming grasses produce large, open, airy inflorescences that can add lightness and motion to the garden. The genus has undergone much revision by botanists, and some of its former members are now known by other names; for one example, see Nassella tenuissima, the highly ornamental Mexican feather grass. Deer don't seem to care for these grasses.
