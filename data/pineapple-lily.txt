It's easy to see how these unusual plants from southern Africa got their common namethe summertime spikes of tiny, closely packed, star-shaped blossoms are topped with leaflike bracts resembling those of a pineapple. They make striking cut flowers. Purplish seed capsules follow the flowers, keeping the show going even longer. Leaves are coarse and straplike, emerging from large bulbs to form a basal rosette. Plants go dormant in winter. Not browsed by deer.Plant bulbs 5 inches deep and 8 inches apart in well-drained, humus- rich soil in fallor start plants from seed in spring. Bulbs are hardy to about 5F; where temperatures dip lower, mulch plantings heavily in late fall, or dig and store bulbs over winter. Divide clumps when they become crowded (every 5 or 6 years). Pineapple lilies can also be grown as houseplants beside a bright (south- or west-facing) window; while they are actively growing, give plenty of water and feed monthly with a general- purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer.
