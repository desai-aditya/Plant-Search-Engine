Evergreen or semievergreen ground coversmosslike, beautiful, and easy to grow in humid, moist shade and slightly acid soils with lots of organic matter. Some of the many species form erect tufts of green often mistaken for ferns, but most spread very low to the ground, the sprawling stems rooting as they grow.
