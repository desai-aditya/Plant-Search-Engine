Mexican natives that form rosettes of fleshy leaves, often marked or overlaid with deeper colors. Baby plants (offsets) form around the mother plant, hence, the common name. (For other plants called hen and chicks, see Sempervivum.) Bell-shaped, nodding flowers, usually pink, red, or yellow, in long, slender, sometimes branched clusters. Good in rock gardens. Some make good houseplants if sited in a south- or west-facing window; they benefit from being moved outdoors to a lightly shaded spot during the warm months. Feed houseplants monthly with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer diluted to half-strength; reduce feeding and watering in winter.
