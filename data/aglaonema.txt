Grown for their highly ornamental foliage, these tropical plants are made for low light. In most areas, they are grown strictly indoors.  Aglaonema modestum, the most popular species, will thrive in an interior room lit only by a fluorescent light. In the Tropical South, aglaonemas can be used outdoors in shady plantings.With the recent arrival of colorful selections from Thailand, aglaonemas have been transformed from the familiar green-and-silver houseplants to specimens splashed with color like a croton, coleus, or caladium. These new spangled plants have the same leathery texture to the leaf and grow well indoors. Look for names such as 'Sparkling Sarah', 'Siam Aurora', 'Valentine', and many more.Potted plants need rich, well-drained soil mix. Let soil go slightly dry between waterings; in spring and summer, fertilize every other week with general-purpose houseplant fertilizer. Plants growing in dim light will require less frequent watering and feeding. Mealybugs are the most common pests.
