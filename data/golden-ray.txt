These stately perennials from China and Japan form 3 feet-wide clumps of large leaves topped by daisy-type flowers in yellow to orange. All need rich soil, plenty of moisture, and some shade; they do not tolerate low humidity or hot afternoon sun. Good around pools, along streambeds, in bog gardens. Control slugs  and snails. Clumps can remain undisturbed for years; if more plants are needed, divide clumps in early spring.
