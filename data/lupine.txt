There are hundreds of lupine species, many of them native to the southwestern U.S.; they're found in a wide range of habitats, from alpine rocks to beach sand. Leaves are divided into many leaflets (like fingers of a hand). Sweet peashaped flowers are borne in dense spikes at stem ends. Most lupines take poor soil, but hybrids prefer rich, slightly acidic, well-drained soil.
