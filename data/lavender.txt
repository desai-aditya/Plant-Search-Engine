Native to the Mediterranean region, lavender is prized for its showy, fragrant, lavender or purple flowers. The blossom spikes of some species are used for perfume, aromatic oil, soap, sachets, medicine, and flavoring. Narrow, aromatic, blue-green or gray-green foliage is a hallmark.Unfortunately, the South's hot, humid climate and heavy soils don't suit most lavenders at all. English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), considered by many the most desirable species, is also the most problematic in Southern gardens. Poor drainage, wet winters, and high humidity often lead to rot and quick demise. Success depends on planting in gravelly, fast-draining soil that contains few nutrients. Do not fertilize. To reduce humidity around plants, mulch with gravel. To keep plants neat and compact, shear back by one-third to one-half every year just after bloom. If they become woody and open in the center, remove a few of the oldest branches; take out more when new growth comes.To dry flowers for sachets and potpourri, cut the spikes or strip blossoms from stems just as they show color; dry in a cool, shady place. Dried flowers can also be used to add a fresh scent to water or soap. Dried spikes make fragrant wreaths, swags, and wands. To flavor ice cream, pastries, and salads, use fresh flowers of Lavandula angustifolia and Lavandula intermedia selections; other species contain toxic chemicals that should not be ingested.Because lavenders have been cultivated for centuries and tend to interbreed, many selections and hybrids have arisen. Names are often confused, so some of the names that follow may not agree with those you see on nursery labels. Be aware that only cutting-grown plants are uniform; seed-grown strains vary in color and growth habit. Deer do not care for lavender.
