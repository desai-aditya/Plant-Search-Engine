Formerly Bignonia violacea,  B. speciosa. Strong-growing vine from Argentina and Brazil will clamber over anything by tendrils; needs support on walls. Leaves are 34 inches long, divided into two glossy, dark green leaets with wavy margins. Extended terminal shoots hang down to create a curtainlike effect. Blooms from late spring to fall, bearing trumpet-shaped blossoms in sprays at ends of shoots; flowers are violet, lavender, or pale purple, 3 inches long and nearly as wide at the open end. Tops hardy to 20F, roots to 10F. Excellent vine for areas of Florida too cold for more tender bignonia relatives such as Pandorea. Remove unwanted long runners and spent ower sprays. Prune in late winter to discipline growth.
