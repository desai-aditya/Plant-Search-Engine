Most germanders are from the Mediterranean, though one listed here (Teucrium canadense) is native to eastern North America. All have aromatic evergreen foliage and whorls of little flowers. These are tough plants that endure poor, rocky soils; most can't stand wet or poorly drained soils but will tolerate regular watering where drainage is good. Not usually browsed by deer.
