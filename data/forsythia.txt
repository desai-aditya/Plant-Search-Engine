Though it's originally from China and Korea, this harbinger of spring has adorned Southern gardens for so long that folks assume it's native. At garden centers, it's often the top-selling flowering deciduous shrub because it's inexpensive, easy to grow, and dependably colorful. From late winter to early spring, countless yellow, 34- to 112 inches flowers smother the arching, leafless branches. During the rest of the growing season, the medium green foliage blends well with that of other shrubs. Fall color is inconsistent, but leaves may turn purplish or burgundy.Forsythia can be used as a clipped hedge, an informal screen, a bank cover, or part  of a shrub border. It thrives in most well-drained soils. Somewhat resistant to damage by  deer. Rejuvenate after bloom  by cutting a third of the oldest canes to the ground in late  spring; also remove dead wood and old, woody branches. Prune to preserve graceful, fountain- like form; do not shear into  balls or boxes. Cut branches  are easy to rootjust stick them into moist soil.
