Native to Asia Minor. Caraway is prized for its edible seeds, used in flavoring pickles, vegetables, and breads. In the first year after planting, carrotlike leaves grow from a taproot, forming a mound 12 feet high. In the second spring, umbrellalike clusters of white flowers rise above the foliage and set seed; after the seeds ripen in midsummer, the plant dies.Start seeds in a garden bed in fall or early spring; be sure soil is well drained. Thin seedlings to  112 feet apart. Harvest the seed heads after they have turned brown, then dry them in paper bags until you can shake the seeds loose.
