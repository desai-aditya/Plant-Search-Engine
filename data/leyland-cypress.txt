Hybrid of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis and Cupressus macrocarpa. Grows very fast (from cuttings to 1520 feet in 5 years). Usually reaches 6070 feet tall and 815 feet wide in gardens. Widely planted as a quick screen; becoming quite popular as a cut Christmas tree in Lower and Coastal South. Long, slender, upright branches of attened gray-green foliage sprays give youthful tree a narrow pyramidal form, though it can become open and oppy. Can be pruned into tall (10- to 15 feet) hedge but will quickly get away from you without regular maintenance. Grows much too large to be planted near the house. Produces small cones composed of scales. Accepts a wide variety of soil and climate conditions; takes strong wind. Susceptibility to canker and root rot diseases has killed thousands in recent years. Bagworms are another serious pest. Popular selections include 'Castlewellan', with golden new growth and narrow, erect habit; 'Emerald Isle', with bright green foliage on plant 2025 feet tall and 68 feet wide; 'Gold Rider' also has golden new growth and eventually forms a pyramid 35 feet high by 15 feet wide; and 'Naylor's Blue', bearing grayish blue foliage.
