Group of approximately 60 spe- cies native to Africa and India. Admired for their stiff, attractive leaves, which grow from rhizomes. Very popular as houseplants; can also be grown outdoors in mild- winter areas. Outdoors, they accept sun or light shade and just about any well-drained soil, tolerat- ing drought and even salt spray. Indoors, they do best in bright light but will accept dim light. Allow soil to go dry between soakings. For best growth, feed monthly in spring and summer with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer diluted to half-strength. Easy to root from leaf cuttings. Mature, pot- bound plants may occasionally bear spikelike clusters of fragrant flowers in spring or summer.Few plants boast such colorful common names.
