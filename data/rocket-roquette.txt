This Mediterranean native, some- times called rocket, roquette, or rucola coltivata, is grown for its leaves that resemble small mustard leaves and lend a peppery zing to green salads. Along with radishes, turnips, and the whole cabbage clan, it's a member of the cress family. Start from seed in winter or spring; grows best in cool weather. In Florida and South Texas, sow seed in fall and winter; elsewhere, sow in early spring or early fall. Thin to about 6 inches apart. Harvest tender young leaves; older, larger ones usually taste too sharp. Sow new seeds every two weeks to always have young plants. Eventually plants will shoot up to 3 feet tall and bloom. Tender buds and flowers taste like the young leaves. Plants reseed. Easy to grow in containers. Choose a wide bowl at least 6 inches deep. Watch out for cabbage butterfliestheir caterpillars find arugula just as tasty as cabbage.
