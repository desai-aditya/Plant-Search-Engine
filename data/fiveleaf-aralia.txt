Native to China, Japan. Grows 810 feet tall and wide; erect, eventually arching stems have short thorns below each leaf. Bright green leaves have five to seven 1- to 212 inches-long leaflets arranged like fingers on a hand. Small, inconspicuous white flowers are borne in clusters; these are very occasionally followed by clusters of small black berries. This plant's virtues are its somewhat tropical appearance, adaptability (takes rich or poor soil, any exposure, any amount of irrigation), and high tolerance for difficult conditions, including air pollu- tion. 'Variegatus', a 6- to 8 feet shrub with white-bordered leaflets, is more widely grown than the species. Formerly known as Acanthopanax sieboldianus.
