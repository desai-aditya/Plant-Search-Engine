These mountain natives are valued for their showy flowers and even showier fruit. Blossoms are grouped in broad, flat clusters that are scattered over the foliage canopy in spring; they develop into hanging clusters of small, berrylike fruit that colors up in late summer or early fall. Most species have red or orange-red fruit, but white, pink, and golden forms are occasionally available. Birds feed on the fruit, but usually not until after leaves have fallen. Foliage is typically finely cut and somewhat fernlike, though some less widely planted species have undivided leaves.Mountain ashes need some winter chill, and their dislike of extended summer heat makes them poor choices for most of the South. Where adapted, they are good small garden trees or street trees, though fruit can make a mess on paved surfaces. Provide good, well-drained soil. Like other members of the rose family, they are subject to fireblight. Borers and cankers are problems for plants under stress.
