Neat, well-behaved flowering trees of modest size for patios or lawns; make a nice contrast in front of larger, darker-leafed trees. The species described below put on a spring or early summer show of white, bell-shaped flowers in hanging clusters. Leaves of most are oval and pointed. Easy to garden under, since roots are deep and nonaggressive. Provide good, well-drained, acid soil, except as noted.
