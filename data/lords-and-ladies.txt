Attractively veined, arrow-shaped leaves grow from tubers in fall or winter. In spring, short stalks bear curious, often malodorous, callalike blooms featuring a bract (spathe) that half encloses a thick, fleshy spike (spadix) set with tiny flowers. These blossoms are followed by dense clusters of fruit, typically bright red, that look like little ears of corn and persist after leaves have died to the ground. Use this plant in shady flower borders or as a tropical-looking ground cover.Plant tubers during late summer or in early autumn (toward the end of their dormancy), setting them 812 inches apart and about 2 inches deep. Dormant plantings accept summer water but don't need it. Arum palaestinum and A.pictum are sometimes used as houseplants in colder climates.
