Native to South America. Heavy trunk is studded with thick  spines; it is green in youth, turns gray with age. Leaves divided into 5 inches-long leaflets like fingers of a hand; they drop during autumn flowering or whenever temperatures fall below 27F. Large, showy flowers somewhat resemble narrow-petaled hibiscus blooms. Fast drainage and controlled watering are keys to success. Water established trees about once a month during the growing season; ease off in late summer to encourage more flowers. Need little pruning except to remove wayward or dead growth.
