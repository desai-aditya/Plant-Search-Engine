Thanks to the tropical look of their oversize leaves and huge, exotic blossoms, brugmansias are wildly popular. Related to jimsonweeds, these South American natives are often confused with plants in the genus Daturabut brugmansias are large, woody shrubs with typically pendent flowers and bean-shaped seedpods; daturas are lower growing and herbaceous, with upward-pointing flowers and swollen, spiny seedpods. Most brugmansias bloom in summer and autumn. For Datura, see page 276.Brugmansias prefer moist, fertile, well-drained soil that contains plenty of organic matter. Boggy soil results in gradual dieback and eventual death. A site providing morning sun and light afternoon shade is ideal. During active growth in spring and summer, water freely and feed every 2 weeks with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. In fall and winter, reduce watering and cease feeding. Prune only after flowering.Brugmansias are winter hardy in the Coastal and Tropical South (USDA 9-11). In the Lower South (USDA 8), heavy mulching in late fall is necessary. In the Upper and Middle South (USDA 6-7), treat them as annuals or grow them in containers that you take indoors for winter. Potted plants can spend winters indoors with low light and little water.
