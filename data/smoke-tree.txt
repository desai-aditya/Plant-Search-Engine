Unusual and colorful shrub-trees creating broad, urn-shaped mass usually as wide as high. Naturally multistemmed but can be trained to a single trunk. Common name derived from dramatic puffs of smoke from fading flowers: As the tiny greenish blooms wither, they send out elongated stalks clothed in a profusion of fuzzy, lavender-pink hairs. Plants tolerate poor or rocky soil. In cultivated gardens, give them fast drainage and avoid overly wet conditions. Not browsed by deer.
