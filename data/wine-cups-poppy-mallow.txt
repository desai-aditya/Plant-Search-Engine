Few perennials can match the eye-popping show of wine cups in full bloom. Native to the American Southwest and Midwest, they grow from fleshy roots to become wide-spreading mats of foliage; the leaves are deeply cut, resembling those of some scented geraniums. A profusion of cup-shaped flowers smothers the plant during hot weather. As long as they have good drainage, wine cups will tolerate infertile soil and intense heat. Use them at front of border and on slopes.
