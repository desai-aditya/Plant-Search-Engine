These conifers have tiny, scalelike leaves, closely set on cordlike branches, and interesting globular, golf ballsize cones made up of shield-shaped scales. For the dry Southwest, choose  Cupressus arizonica or Cupressus sempervirens; these species and their selections thrive in dry, rocky, alkaline soil. In high-rainfall areas, however, they are short lived; Cupressus lusitanica is the better choice there. Cypresses are not browsed by deer.
