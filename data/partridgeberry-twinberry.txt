Attractive small, creeping ever- green plant native to much of eastern North America. Roundish leaves are less than 1 inches long, borne in pairs along trailing, somewhat woody stems that root where they touch the ground. Paired, small white flowers appear in late spring or early summer; these are followed by bright red berries less than  14 inches across. Small-scale ground cover best seen near eye level, such as on a shady bank or above a wall. Ideal for a woodland garden among shade-loving native plants such as ferns, mosses, may apple (Podophyllum peltatum), and galax. Provide steady moisture and acid soil containing plenty of leaf mold  or other organic material.
