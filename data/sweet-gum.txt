People often are of two minds when it comes to sweet gums: They praise them for their ravishing fall color but curse  them for their copious gum balls. Distinguished by their maplelike leaves, they're upright, conical trees that spread with age. Inconspicuous flowers are followed by spiny seed balls that are a boon for fans of dried arrangements but a bane for those who like to walk barefoot. Seedless selections are becoming available, however, so the best of both worlds could be in sight.Provide fertile, well-drained, slightly acid to neutral soil; alkaline soil often causes chlorosis (yellow leaves with green veins), and the problem can be hard to correct. Prune young trees to develop a strong central leader. Mature trees need little pruning.Given ample room, sweet gums make fine street and shade trees, though their surface roots can be a problem in lawns or in the narrow space between sidewalk and curb. Fall foliage is brilliant in the Upper and Middle South, less so in the Lower, Coastal, and Tropical South. Young plants are somewhat resistant to browsing deer.Five- to seven-lobed, 3- to 7 inches-wide leaves are deep green in spring and summer, turning to purple, yellow, or red in fall. Seedling trees usually give good fall color, though color varies widely. To get desired and uniform color, purchase named selections, preferably while they are in fall color. Good selections include the following.
