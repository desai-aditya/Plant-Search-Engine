Native to the tropics of the Americas, angelonia is perennial in the Coastal and Tropical South but grown as an annual in most other places. It looks a bit like a shorter delphinium, but it blooms all summer and loves the heat. Showy spikes of blue, purple, pink, or white blossoms appear atop plants that grow 11 feet tall and about 1 feet wide. Periodic deadheading keeps the flowers coming. Excellent both as bedding plants and in containers; provides long-lasting cut flowers. Easy to grow in moist, well-drained soil; not bothered by pests. Deer don't usually eat it.Many hybrids are offered. The AngelMist series (1424 inches tall) features a variety of colors, including plum, lavender, and white; some flowers are marked with white, pink, or purple. In the Carita series (1824 inches tall), stems branch at the base, giving the plant a full look. Blossoms are deep pink, lavender, purple, or white. Carita Purple is a particularly good performer. The Serena series (1620 inches tall) is compact, and 'Serena Purple' is among the best for the Southern garden. The Serenita series is similar, but shorterplants grow 610 inches tall. The Alonia series features heavily branched plants to 15 inches tall with large, showy flowers. Low-growing, spreading types are ideal for hanging baskets, containers, or in ground cover situations.
