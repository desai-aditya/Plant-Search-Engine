Most are hardy only in the Coastal and Tropical South, though Curcuma elata, Curcuma longa 'Bright White', Curcuma petiolata, and Curcuma rubescens 'Scarlet Fever' will winter over in the Lower South. They make excellent additions to mixed borders. Plant in spring, setting rhizomes 1 inches deep in moist, well-drained, humus-rich soil. Plants die down in winter and need very little water during dormancy.
