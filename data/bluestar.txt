These elegant milkweed relatives are native to the South. Plants grow 23 feet high and wide, with narrow leaves and erect stems crowned by clusters of small, star-shaped blue flowers in late spring. They are among the best perennials for fall colorfoliage turns bright yellow in autumn. All are tough plants that succeed in ordinary soil. They tolerate some drought and suffer from few pests. Deer don't eat them.
