No tree has more beautiful bark than a white-barked birchthe tree that comes to mind when most people think of birches. Trouble is, these trees are often difficult to keep alive in most of the South. Native to mountainous areas, where summers are cooler and winters long, they tend to struggle when faced with the hot summers common to our region. And they often succumb to a serious pest: the bronze birch borer, which causes them to die slowly from the top down.Fortunately, a number of birches that resemble white-barked birches do succeed here; they too have a graceful habit; thin bark that peels in sheets; and small, finely toothed leaves that turn glowing yellow in fall. After the leaves drop, the trees' delicate limbs, handsome bark, and small, conelike fruit provide a striking winter display.Birches need a steady supply of moisture at all times; drought in summer can cause leaf drop. All fall victim to aphids that drip honeydew; for this reason, they should never be planted near a porch, patio, or parking area. Plant in fertile, slightly acid soil; most prefer good drainage. Prune in summer to remove weak, damaged, or dead branches; trees will bleed sap if pruned in winter. Susceptibility to heat and the bronze birch borer limits most birches to the Upper and Middle South.
