Flame vine is as brilliant as it sounds, with branch-end clusters of tubular, 3 inches., orange flowers lighting up this 2040 feet ever- green vine during winter; in warmest gardens, bloom starts in fall and continues into spring. Native to South America. Climbs rapidly by tendrils, twining along fences and eaves and over pergolas and arbors, ultimately spilling off retaining walls and covering banks. Leaves consist of two or three oval, 2 inches leaflets; paired leaflets have a tendril between them rather than a third leaflet. Plants growing in Florida sometimes form slender, foot-long fruit capsules. In central Florida, this is the most popular vine for covering fences and other structures.Tolerates many soils. Revels in heat; in cooler climates, plant along a south- or west-facing wall. Prune in spring or summer, after bloom has finished. Formerly known as P. ignea, Bignonia venusta.
