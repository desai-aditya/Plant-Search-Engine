Clumps of grassy, 1- to 112 feet-long leaves give rise to slender, hollow stems, each bearing a single funnel-shaped flower with six segments. Flowers of some kinds resemble lilies; those of other types look like crocuses. In the wild, flowers bloom after a rain (hence the common name rain lily), and they may appear in the garden after a good soaking. These are old-timey passalong plants. Deer don't bother with them.Need little care. Pretty in rock garden or foreground of border. Excellent pot plant for patio or greenhouse. Plant in early summer; set bulbs 12 inches deep, 3 inches apart. In the Upper South, mulch hardier species heavily over winter. Container plants bloom better when somewhat pot-bound.
