This elegant little plant hails from the mountains of Georgia, Tennessee, and North and South Carolina; it is difficult to grow outside of its small native range. Forms a foot-wide clump of evergreen, round or oval, glossy green, 1- to 3 inches-long leaves with scalloped edges. Each of the many 4- to 6 inches-high stems is topped in spring with a single blooma nodding, 1-inch-wide white bell with toothed edges. Spreads slowly by underground stems. Intolerant of extended summer heat. Needs acid, organically enriched soil. Grow with azaleas and rhododendrons.
