Frequently spotted on old homesites and in cemeteries, most are native to China or Japan. Narrow, strap-shaped leaves appear in spring (or in fall, in mild-winter regions); they remain green until some point in summer, then die down completely. Leafless flower stalks emerge after the foliage disappears. In late summer or early fall, each stalk bears a cluster of blooms with narrow, pointed, petal-like segments andin some speciesprojecting, spidery-looking stamens. Blossoms may be funnel shaped or have segments splayed outward or reflexed.Plant in late summer, setting bulbs in well-drained soil about  1 feet apart. Keep tops of bulb necks at or just above soil surfaceexcept in coldest part of range, where tops of necks should be just under surface. Water regularly while plants are growing and again when flower stalks emerge. Disturb clumps  (after bloom) only when you want to move them or divide them to increase a planting. Beyond hardiness range, grow spider lilies in containers, and overwinter them indoors.
