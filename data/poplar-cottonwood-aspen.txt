Poplars may be popular out West, but in the South they're proble- matic. They're messy, pest and disease prone, weak wooded, and short lived. Their aggressive surface roots crowd out other plants, invade water lines, and crack pavement. Cut or disturb the roots, and they'll sucker profusely. If your yard already has a poplar, leave it or remove it, but don't ever plant one unless you live in West Texas. (This warning does not apply to tulip poplar [Liriodendron tulipifera], which belongs to a different genus and makes a fine shade tree.)Some poplars are beautiful or distinctive enough that people buy them despite their liabilities. Several have good fall color. Leaves of most poplars are roughly triangular, sometimes toothed or lobed. Pendulous catkins appear before spring leaf-out; those on male trees are denser textured. Female trees later bear masses of cottony seeds that blow about and become a nuisance; for that reason, male (seedless) selections are offered in garden centers. Deer don't usually browse poplars.
