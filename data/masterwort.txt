Flowering stems rise from leafy clumps in summer, bearing dense, tight clusters of blossoms surrounded by papery bracts. Flower heads look something like pincushions; they make attractive, long-lasting cut flowers and can also be dried for winter arrangements. Useful plants for woodland or cottage gardens. Native to alpine woods and meadows of Europe. Spread by underground runners. Die back in winter, even in mild climates. Best where summer nights dip below 70F. Need good drainage. Deer resistant.
