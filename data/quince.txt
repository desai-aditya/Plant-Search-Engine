Fruiting quince is a multistemmed shrub to 1520 feet tall and wide. White or blush pink flowers bloom in midspring; these are followed in autumn by fragrant, yellow, round to pear-shaped or oblong fruit traditionally used in the South for jelly and preserves. Fruit reaches 34 inches long and remains as hard as a golf ball even after ripening. Native to Asia. For flowering quince, see Chaenomeles. Discussed here is the closely related Cydonia oblonga, a native of western Asia grown for fruit rather than flowers (it is often confused with flowering quince).Quince is easy to grow in a sunny spot with slightly acid, well-drained soil; once established, it is incredibly tenacious and nearly impossible to kill, deliberately or otherwise. Named selections are usually available only through mail-order catalogs. Some selections need a pollenizer; planting at least two different ones ensures cross-pollination and larger crops.
