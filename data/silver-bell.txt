These elegant and underappreciated trees are native to the Southeast. Bell-shaped white flowers appear in spring, usually just before the leaves emerge. Medium green foliage turns yellow in fall. Pretty in woodland gardens. Good substitute for dogwood (Cornus) where dogwoods will not grow. Grow best in rich, well-drained, acid soil. Buy container-grown plants, as balled-and-burlapped ones do not transplant easily.Plants in the Vestita Group, sometimes offered as Halesia c. vestita, top out at about 30 feet tall and 20 feet wide, with larger flowers than those of the species. 'Rosea' has light pink flowers.
