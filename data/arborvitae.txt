Neat, symmetrical plants often mistakenly trimmed into odd geometrical formsglobes, cones, cylinders. Juvenile foliage is feathery, with small, needlelike leaves; mature foliage is scalelike, carried in flat sprays. Foliage in better-known selections is often yellow-green or bright golden yellow. Small (12- to 34 inches-long) cones are green or bluish green, turning to brownish. Although arborvitaes will take both damp and fairly dry soils, they grow best in well-drained soil. Bagworms and spider mites are common pests on all species.
