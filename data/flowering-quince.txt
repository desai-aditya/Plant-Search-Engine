These are among the first shrubs to bloom each year. As early as January, you can bring a budded stem indoors, place it in water in a sunny window, and watch it burst into flower. Blossoms are 112212 inches across, single to semidouble or double, in a wide range of colors. Leaves are red tinged when young, then mature to shiny green. Most types are thorny, take pruning well, and make excellent barriers and hedges. Not browsed by deer.Flowering quince is easy to grow and practically indestructible; its only requirements are sun and well-drained soil. Even if leaf spot (a common disease in humid areas) defoliates the plant by midsummer, the next year's bloom won't be reduced. Prune to shape the plant or reduce its sizeeither immediately after bloom or during the flowering season (you can use cut branches in bloom for indoor arrangements). Lack of winter chill may lead to sparse bloom in the Coastal South.Some selections bear small (2- to 4 inches.), hard, delightfully fragrant fruits. Although not as tasty as that of common quince (Cydonia oblonga; see Quince), the fruit contains lots of pectin, making it good for jelly or preserves. If your flowering quince fails to bear, it probably needs cross-pollination with another selection.The following list of garden hybrids gives height and flower color. Tall types reach 6 feet or taller, low types 23 feet Most are broader than tall.
