Native to tropical Asia, these small, shade-loving plants  grow outdoors only in humid, very warm climates. Flowers (sometimes fragrant) resemble small orchids or African violets (Saintpaulia) but have just three petals, one of which is a deeply lobed lip. Foliage is usually  more decorative than the flowers; leaves of many species have iridescent veining and feathery zoning, giving them the look of  a peacock's tail. Leaves of most species lie horizontally, making  a low (1- to 6 inches-tall), strikingly textured ground cover during the growing season. In winter, foliage dies back and plant becomes dormant. Reduce watering in  fall; stop watering altogether in winter; resume watering in spring. Plants grow easily in moist soil with lots of organic matter. Some spread by rhizomes. Tuberous types can be divided.In the Upper, Middle, and Lower South, grow in containers and overwinter indoors. Keep nighttime temperature above 60F. During growing season, air and soil must be moist and daytime temperatures high; plants will thrive in temperatures over 90F.
