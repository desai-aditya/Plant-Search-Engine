Native to the deserts and mountains of the Southwest and Mexico, these yucca relatives tolerate dry, rocky, alkaline soil and considerable drought, though some irrigation will speed growth. They resemble Nolinabut unlike those plants, most sotols have sharp prickles along their leaf margins.Given plenty of room to spread out, sotols make a bold statement in the garden. Their long, narrow leavesranging in color from dark green to blue-green to silverycan be upright or drooping. The foliage rosette sits atop a woody base that can, with age, form a treelike trunk. Mature plants may bloom in summer, bearing tiny flowers in tight clusters on a tall, narrow spike. There are male and female plants; you need one of each to obtain seed.Fast-draining soil is essential. If your soil is heavy, amend it with lots of sand and coarse gravel, or plant in large containers. Spring is the best time for planting. Mulch with gravel rather than organic matter, and keep plants as dry as possible during winter. Promptly remove old, withered leaves at the base for a neater appearance. Pests aren't usually a problem.
