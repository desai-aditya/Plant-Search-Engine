Native to tropical regions, where they grow on trees; gardeners grow them on slabs of bark or tree fern stem, occasionally in hanging baskets or attached to trees. They do best with regular moisture, though they can dry out briefly without suffering damage.These ferns have two kinds of fronds. Sterile ones are pale green in color, aging to tan and brown; they support the plant and accumulate organic matter to help feed it. Fertile fronds vary in color from gray-green to deep green; they are forked, resembling spreading antlers held either erect or pendent. For plants growing on slabs, be sure to water behind the sterile frond that attaches it to the slab.
