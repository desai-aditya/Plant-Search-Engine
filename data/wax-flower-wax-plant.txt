Tropical plants with thick, waxy evergreen leaves and tight clusters of small, waxy flowers that appear in leaf joints during summer. These plants prefer rich, loose, well-drained soil. When grown as container plants, they bloom best when pot bound. Do not prune out the short stalks that bear flowers, because new flower clusters will develop on them. Feed with a quarter-strength general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer monthly from spring through fall. Specialists list dozens of available species and hybrids, with growth habit varying from vining to shrubby.
