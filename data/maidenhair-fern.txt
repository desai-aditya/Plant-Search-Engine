It would be hard to imagine daintier, more graceful ferns than the maidenhairs. Most hail from the tropics, but some originate in North America. Dark, thin, wiry stems hold delicate, finely cut fronds. In most types, the individual leaflets are bright green and fan shaped. Most resist deer.Maidenhairs typically need rich organic soil, steady moisture, and shade. Tender species are useful as houseplants. Provide bright filtered or indirect light and apply a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer diluted to half strength once a month in spring and summer.
