Choice plants for connoisseurs of blue flowers. Bear one-sided clusters of lobelia-like blooms in brilliant blue, violet, or white; blue and violet flowers are striking because of contrasting white eye or throat. Bloom profusely in            warm shade or filtered sunlight. Graceful in hanging baskets or pots. Fine cut flowers. Sow seeds in early spring for summer bloom, in fall for winter color in warmest- winter areas or indoors. You can lift plants in fall, cut back, and pot; new            growth will produce flowers through winter in warm spots.
