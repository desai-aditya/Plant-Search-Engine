These tropical beauties grow  from rhizomes that produce leafy clumps. Plants are evergreen in the Tropical South, but they are root hardy to about 15F. They often need to settle in for 2 years after planting before they start to bloom; the clusters of - to 2 inches blossoms typically appear in summer. Give moist, fertile, well- drained soil and a wind-sheltered location. Most form clumps half to fully as wide as they are tall. Each year, cut back to the ground all canes that have finished flowering.
