Lacy foliage and beautifully presented flowers in exquisite pastels, deeper shades, and  white give columbines a fairylike, woodland-glen quality. Plants are erect and range in size from 2 inches  to 4 feet high. Divided leaves similar to maidenhair fern (Adiantum) may be fresh green, blue-green, or gray-green. Slender, branching stems carry erect or nodding flowers to 3 inches across, often with sepals and petals in contrasting colors; they usually have backward-projecting, nectar-bearing spurs. Some columbines have large flowers and very long spurs; these have an airier look than short-spurred and spurless kinds. Double-flowered types  lack the delicacy of the single- flowered sort, but they make a bolder color mass. Blossoms typically appear in spring and early summer.Columbines are not fussy about soil as long as it is well drained. Cut back old stems for second crop of flowers. All kinds attract hummingbirds. Deer tend to leave them alone. Most are not long lived and will need to be replaced every 3 or 4 years. Allow the spent flowers to form seed capsules to ensure a crop of volunteer seedlings. If you're growing hybrids, the seedlings won't necessarily duplicate the parent plants, but seedlings from species (if grown isolated from other columbines) should closely resemble the originals. Leaf miners are a potential pest, especially on hybrids.
