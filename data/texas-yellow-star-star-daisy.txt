This rugged Texas native forms  a basal rosette of coarse, tapered leaves that reach 23 inches long. Thick, hairy stems rise 12 feet tall and are topped by star-shaped, yellow flowers to 1 inches across. Blooms profusely from March through May, providing early color for wildflower gardens. Spent petals drop cleanly. Does best in dryish, sandy or rocky soil. Space plants about 1 feet apart.
