These attractive shrubs are grown for the small, five-lobed, sweet-scented white or pink flowers that cluster at branch tips in mid- to late summer. Tolerate many soils but do best in moist, organic, slightly acid, well-drained soil. Prefer partial shade but can adapt successfully to less light as well as to full sun, though they need some shade where summers are very hot. Remove some old wood from base annually before spring growth begins. Not browsed by deer.Selections include the following; most grow about as wide as tall.
