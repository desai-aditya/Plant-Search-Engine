Native to the eastern U.S. Light green, oblong leaves to 10 inches long form a basal rosette nearly a foot across. In early to midspring, leafless stalks rise to 16 inches high, topped by many-flowered clusters of - to  inches-long blossoms in white to occasionally pink or purple with quite prominent, downward-pointing yellow stamens. Swept-back petals give blooms the look of small comets or shooting stars. Dies back completely at onset of hot weather. Prefers rich, loose, well-drained soil. Excellent in woodland gardens.
