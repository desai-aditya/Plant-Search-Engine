Native from Texas to Argentina, these bulbous plants sprout and bloom almost immediately following a summer rain (thus their common name). Their trumpet- to funnel-shaped blossoms closely resemble those of their relatives, Zephyranthes. Plant bulbs in spring or summer in well-drained soil, spacing them 3 inches apart, with tips at soil level. Plant in sweeps for best effect. Good plants for the front of borders, in rock gardens, or in naturalized areas. In areas where ground freezes in winter, grow in pots. Best with winter moisture and dry summers with occasional downpours.
