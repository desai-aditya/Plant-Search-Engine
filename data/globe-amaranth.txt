Stiffly branching plants to 12 feet tall, 1 feet wide, covered in summer and fall with rounded, papery, cloverlike flower heads 341 inches wide. These are easy to dry, retaining color and shape for winter arrangements. Narrow, oval leaves are 24 inches long. Drought tolerant and easy to grow; rarely bothered by pests, including deer. It's easy to harvest seeds from the faded flowers and save them for planting next year; start indoors or sow in place after soil has warmed in spring.
