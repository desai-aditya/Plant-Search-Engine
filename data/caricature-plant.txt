This frost-tender native of New Guinea is prized for its fancy marbled foliage. Reaching 68 feet tall and wide, it features handsome, glossy, deep green leaves about 6 inches long and half as broad. Distinctive cream-colored marbling decorates each leaf along the midrib. In summer, purplish red, tubular, 112 inches-long flowers are borne in short clusters. 'Alba Variegata' has leaves heavily and irregularly edged with cream. Aurea Marginada' is similar but with golden edges. 'Chocolate' offers leaves mottled burgundy-green and bronze, with pinkish cream marbling and deep pink midribs. 'El Dorado' has medium green leaves with wide, irregular margins of golden yellows. 'Tricolor' has bright green leaves with white marbling and pink midribs. In frostless locations, may be used as a landscape plant in light shade; the broad, colorful leaves make a good contrast to ferns.Plant in well-drained soil con- taining lots of organic matter. Elsewhere, grow in pots that are brought indoors to a bright  location during late fall and  winter, or grow as houseplants year-round. Keep soil evenly  moist and make sure potting mix drains well. Prune lightly or pinch out growing tips to promote bushy growth. Propagate by cuttings. Susceptible to nematodes in Florida.
