Most kiwi vines are valued for delicious fruit, but this eastern Asian species is grown for its flamboyant foliage. Grows rapidly to 15 feet or more, producing a marvelous mass of 3- to 5 inches-long leaves with elongated heart shape, some in solid green, others white-splashed green, others green variegated in pink to red. Female selections produce small fruit, but males (which are nonfruiting) typically have better leaf color. Color is best in cool weather andin warmer regionsin partial shade. 'September Sun' has sweet fruit and the best foliage variegation among female selections. Small, fragrant white flowers appear in early summer. Plants climb by twining; provide sturdy support and train new stems into place. Prune in late dormant season. For information on growing kiwi vines for their fruit, see Kiwi.
