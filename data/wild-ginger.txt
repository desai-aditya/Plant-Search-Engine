Roots and leaves of the wild gingers have a scent somewhat like that of culinary ginger (Zingiber), but they are not used as seasoning. Low, creeping plants bearing roundish or heart-shaped leaves, they make very attractive woodland ground covers. Their flowers are curious rather than showy, almost hidden among the leaves; they are small (usually less than 2 inches wide) and oddly shaped, with three spreading, leathery lobes that may be brownish, purplish, or greenish. Of the many species that exist, only a few are available to gardeners. Asiatic species with fancy variegated leaves, now grown as connoisseurs' plants in Japan, may eventually make their way here. Deer resistant.
