Shrubs with leaves divided featherwise into many leaflets. Spikelike, 3- to 6 inches-long clusters of blue or purple, single-petaled flowers typically bloom in early summer. In cold weather, plants may die back nearly to the ground; in warmer areas, they should be cut back severely to prevent lankiness. Tough and undemanding, withstanding heat and wind. Butterflies love the flowers.
