Native to eastern U.S. Much loved for the masses of showy blooms it bears in late summer and fall. Tall stems bear broad, mounded clusters of yellow-centered, white, pink, or pale to deeper purple flowers about 34 inches across; blossoms            resemble Michaelmas daisies (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii). Good for the back of the border, it grows to 6 feet or taller and about 3 feet wide; may need support to keep from flopping over after rain or over- head watering. Needs moist, fertile soil            containing lots of organic matter and will tolerate very damp soil.
