This heat-loving group includes several showy shrubs, one of which can be grown as a vine and another as a tree. All feature 2 inches-long, trumpet-shaped flowers in the yellow-orange-red range and leaves divided featherwise into many leaflets. Excellent for attracting butterflies and hummingbirds. Easy to grow in well-drained soil. Take drought but look best with periodic soakings. Remove faded flowers to prolong bloom and lessen production of seedpods. Resist damage from browsing deer.
