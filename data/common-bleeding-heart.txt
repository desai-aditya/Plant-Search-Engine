Formerly known as Dicentra spectabilis. Native to Japan; old garden favorite. To 2-3 feet high,  3 feet wide; stems are set with soft green leaves. Blooms in spring, bearing big flowers on  one side of arching stems rose-pink, pendulous, heart- shaped, with protruding white inner petals. 'Alba' ('Pantaloons') is a pure white form. 'Gold Heart' has bright golden leaves that  hold their color into summer. 'Valentine' has bright-red flower with white inner petals.Plants usually die down to the ground by midsummer. To keep the gap from showing, plant next to perennials that hold their foliage all summer. Not browsed by deer.
