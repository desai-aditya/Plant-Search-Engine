Famed for having insects for dinner, pitcher plants can also make excellent garden plants. Ten or so species inhabit bogs from Maryland south to Florida. They are found where soils are constantly moist but only briefly flooded, and where periodic wildfires remove encroaching trees and shrubs, providing full sun. The soil in such sites is usually nutrient starved and acidic, lacking nitrogen and other elements. Pitcher plants compensate by obtaining these nutrients from the creatures they consume, including insects, spiders, and the occasional small frog.Growing from fleshy roots, plants form whorls of hollow, modified leavesthe pitchers of the common namethat both carry out photosynthesis and trap insects. Attracted by nectar, victims fall into pools of digestive fluid at the bottom of the pitchers. Depending on the species, the pitchers range from a few inches to over 3 feet tall; they may be upright and shaped like tubes or trumpets, or they may look like jugs and lie on the ground. Some have lids above the opening, giving the plant a hooded appearance. Colors include green, yellow-green, burgundy, and bright red, and some pitchers also sport dramatic red veiningapparently a ploy to attract more prey. Showy, solitary spring blossoms in red, pink, or yellow, typically 23 inches across, rise on stalks alongside or above the pitchers. Most species and a number of interesting hybrids resulting from complex crosses are available from mail-order specialists.Pitcher plants need a dormant period in winter, so they're not suited to indoors or the Tropical South. They grow best in sunny bogs. To create a bog garden, dig out a large depression about 112 feet deep, line it with a plastic pond liner, then fill it with a mixture of 2 parts sphagnum peat moss, 1 part perlite, and 1 part builder's sand. Keep the soil constantly moist but not flooded. Do not fertilize, and never feed meat to pitcher plants. Propagate them by seed or division.
