Native to central and eastern North America. Fast growing, especially when young, with upright trunk and spreading, arching branches. To 3570 feet tall and 2535 feet wide. Bright green, fernlike leaves to 10 inches long are divided into many oval, 34- to 112 inches-long leaflets. Late to leaf out; leaves turn golden yellow and drop early in fall. Incon- spicuous flowers are followed by broad, 1- to 112 feet-long pods filled with sweetish pulp and hard, roundish seeds.Foliage casts filtered shade, allowing growth of lawn or other plants beneath. Small leaflets dry up and filter into grass, decreasing raking chores, but pods make a mess in autumn. Trunks and branches of the species are formidably thorny. Honey locusts listed here, however, are selections of G. t. inermis, thornless honey locust, with no thorns and few or no pods.These trees are not good in narrow area between curb and sidewalk, since roots of old plants will heave paving. Stake until good, basic branch pattern is established. Tolerant of acid or alkaline conditions, salt, drought, cold, heat, wind. Prune out any wayward or crossing branches. Susceptible to many pests, several of which are prevalent in humid-summer regions: mimosa webworm (chews leaves), pod gall midge (deforms foliage), honey locust borer (attacks limbs and trunks). Resist deer, however.Popular garden selections include the following.
