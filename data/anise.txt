Mediterranean native to 2 feet tall, 1 feet wide. First growth produces a clump of bright green, roundish to heart-shaped, tooth-edged leaves. Foliage clumps send up stems set with feathery leaves; in summer, stems bear umbrellalike clusters of tiny white flowers at their tips. Use fresh leaves in salads; use seeds for flavoring baked goods, confections.Grow in light, well-drained soil. Plants are fairly wispy and look better when grouped. They develop taproots and do not transplant easily once they pass the seedling stage. Not usually browsed by deer.Intolerance for heat and humidity makes this herb difficult to grow in much of the South. In the Upper and Middle South (USDA 6-7), sow seeds  inches deep in the garden after the last spring frostor get a head start by sowing seeds indoors in peat pots four weeks before the last frost, then planting outdoors once the weather has warmed. Plants take about four months to mature. In the Lower, Coastal, and Tropical South (USDA 8-11) sow seeds in the garden in autumn; plants will grow through the winter and flower in spring. Seed production in these areas is iffy.
