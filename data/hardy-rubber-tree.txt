From central China. Rubber can be made from this tree's sap, but the process isn't economically feasibleinstead, the plant is grown for its ornamental qualities. Attractive rounded habit; can reach 4060 feet tall, with equal or greater spread. Leaves resemble those of  (Ulmus) but are glossier and more leathery. When a leaf is slowly torn in two, sap from the veins congeals into threads of rubber, holding the two halves together. Tolerates a wide variety of soils but requires good drainage. Not troubled by pests. 'Emerald Point' has a more upright, narrow, oval habit and smaller leaves. Useful street tree.
