Formerly known as Elymus arenarius 'Glaucus', this Eurasian dune grass is the bluest ornamental grass of all. It is stunning as a 2- to 3 feet-tall specimen in a flower border or when massed and used as a ground cover. Flowers are inconspicuous. Given moist, fertile soil, it spreads aggressively by rhizomes and can be invasive; better behaved in dry soils and heavy clay. Tolerates heat, drought, deer, sandy soil, and  salt spray. Good plant for the beach or in containers. Mow or cut back in late winter to stimulate fresh new blue growth. 'Findhorn' is a compact selection. 'Blue Dune' has especially bright blue foliage.
