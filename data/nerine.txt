South African relatives of spider lily (Lycoris), which they closely resemble. Most have strap-shaped leaves to about 1 feet long; these usually die back well before bloom time in late summer or early autumn, then reappear later in the year (typically around bloom time or shortly afterward). Some types are essentially ever- green. All have attractive, broad, funnel- or trumpet-shaped flowers carried in clusters atop leafless stems; each blossom has six spreading segments, recurved at their tips.Withhold summer water for species that experience summer dormancy, but keep watering the essentially evergreen kinds. These plants can be grown in pots in areas beyond their hardiness range or where soil cannot be kept dry for summer-dormant types.
