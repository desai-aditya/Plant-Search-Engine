To 1020 feet tall; wider than tall in maturity. Can be trained as a low-branching or multitrunked small tree. Dark green leaves to  312 inches long and half as wide. In late spring or early summer, 2- to 3 inches clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers bloom on previous year's woodbut the main draw is the autumn show of sapphire-blue, 13 inches fruit that garlands the branches. Berries are much appreciated by birds. Single plants set little or no fruit, so it's best to plant groups of seedlings; groups of cutting-grown plants from the same parent will not produce well. Some growers always sell plants in groups of three seedlings to ensure fruiting. Use for screening or as a feature in a large shrub border.
