Nearly 50 species of hedgehog cactus are native to the Southwest, including Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico. Some grow at fairly high elevations, where they survive freezing temperatures. All have cylindrical, ribbed stems in clumps; showy flowers in spring to early summer; and fleshy fruit that is edible in some species. Blooms come in red, yellow, purple, pink, or white and have many rows of petals; they typically close at night. Plant in masses for best effect. Excellent choices for dry-land gardens. Give them maximum sun and gritty, well-drained soil.
