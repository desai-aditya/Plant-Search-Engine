Summer is the season for most yellow daisies, but this European native bears its profuse showy flowers in mid- to late spring. Golden yellow, 1- to 2 inches-wide blossoms are borne singly on 2 feet stems. Good cut flower. Dark green, 2- to 5 inches-long leaves are rounded to heart shaped, with toothed edges; clumps may spread to a width of 3 feet Selections may be of hybrid origin. 'Finesse' has larger flowers (to 3 inches.) on sturdy stems; excellent for cutting. 'Little Leo' is compact, growing just 1215 inches high and wide. 'Magnificum' is a compact grower to about 20 inches tall.Dies back by midsummer, so best used in a strictly spring-flowering scheme or where summer annuals can fill the gap. Combine with white, purple, or lavender tulips and blue violas or forget-me-nots (Myosotis); use in front of purple lilacs (Syringa) or with hellebores at edge of woodland or shade border. Mark location before plant dies back so you don't accidentally disturb it. Provide some moisture during dormancy. Divide clumps every 2 or 3 years in early autumn; young plants bloom best.
