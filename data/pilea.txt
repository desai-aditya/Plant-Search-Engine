Plants in this large group are grown for their colorful, often interestingly patterned and textured leaves; flowers of most are inconspicuous. Many are popular houseplantsbut where hardy, they also make nice outdoor potted plants or even ground covers for shady areas. Outdoors, they'll grow in moist soil in dappled morning sun to full shade.Indoors, they like bright, indirect light and high humidity. Make sure soil is well drained, and let it go somewhat dry between thorough soakings. Feed every other week in spring and summer and once a month in fall and winter with liquid houseplant fertilizer. Mealybugs are common pests; dispatch them by dabbing with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol.
