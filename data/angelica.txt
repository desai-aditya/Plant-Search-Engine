Tropical-looking carrot relatives with divided and toothed, yellow-green leaves 23 feet long. In early summer, the plant sends up a thick, hollow stem to 6 feet tall topped by a 4 feet-wide, umbrella- shaped cluster of small flowers. Dramatic in a woodland garden. Grow in moist, rich soil. Propagate from seeds as soon as they ripen in fall. Because plants are taprooted and don't transplant well, sow seed in place. To prolong plant's life for a few years, cut out the flowering stem as soon as it forms. Best in Upper South
