Most are erect, stiff-branched, thistlelike plants that bloom in summer, putting on a show of striking oval, steel-blue or amethyst flower heads surrounded by spiny blue bracts. They make long-lasting cut flowers and dry well for winter arrangements. Plants are sparsely clothed in deeply cut dark green leaves with spiny-toothed edges; upper leaves and stems are sometimes blue.Another group of sea hollies has long, narrow, spiny-edged leaves that are quite similar to those of yucca. One of these, Eryngium yuccifolium, is native to the U.S.Use sea hollies in borders or fringe areas, in deep, well-drained, sandy or gritty soils that are low in fertility. They are taprooted and difficult to divide, so propagate by root cuttings or by sowing seed in place (thin seedlings to 1 feet apart). Plants often self-sow. Resist deer.
