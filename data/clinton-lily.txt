This lovely and little-known wildflower, native to the upland forests of the Appalachians, is a veritable gem. It gently spreads across the forest floor to form lush mats of deep green, oblong leaves (to 10 inches long and 3 inches wide) that are every bit as attractive as those of lily-of-the-valley (Convallaria majalis).  In late spring, rounded clusters  of 12 inches., fragrant white blossoms (sometimes speckled with purple) appear atop leafless stalks rising 818 inches high. Dis- tinctive round, black berries follow the flowers. Plant dies down in winter. Clinton lily needs moist, well-drained, slightly acid soil that contains lots of organic matter. Mulch around it every spring to keep the roots cool and moist. Water during summer drought. Ideal at the foot of tall trees and shrubs in naturalized areas and woodland gardens. Good companions include rhododendron, mountain laurel (Kalmia), mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum), Christmas fern (Polystichum acrostichoides), trillium, and wild ginger (Asarum).
