Yews are to Northern gardens what hollies are to Southern onesnearly indispensable evergreen plants suited to a multitude of uses. Both serve well as foundation plants, backdrops, tall screens, clipped hedges, and even ground and bank cover. Heat is what limits the use of yews in the South; most types will survive for only a few years outside of the Upper and Middle South. Plum yew (Cephalotaxus) is a good heat-tolerant substitute. Where they grow well, yews are tough plants. They are long lived and can be safely moved even when large. Because yews sprout foliage even from bare wood, they adapt very well to pruning and shearing. They tolerate just about any well-drained soil, and pests are few. Be warned, though: if deer are plentiful where you live, don't bother planting yews, as they'll be quickly devoured.Although they are conifers, yews do not bear cones. Instead, female plants produce juicy, scarlet, berrylike fruit among the dark green needles.
