Resembling a pincushion full of pins, each Scabiosa flower has stamens that protrude well beyond the curved surface of the flower head. Bloom begins in midsummer, continues until frost if flowers are deadheaded or cut regularly. Good in mixed or mass plantings. Excellent cut flowers. Not usually browsed by deer.
