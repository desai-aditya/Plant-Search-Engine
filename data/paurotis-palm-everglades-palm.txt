Beautiful clumping fan palm; native to the Florida Everglades and West Indies. One of its com- mon names, paurotis palm, refers to its former botanical name, Paurotis wrightii. Forms a cluster of slender trunks topped by tufts of fan-shaped, 2- to 3 feet-wide fronds, green above and silvery beneath. Leafstalks are armed with sharp spines. In Florida, it reaches 30 feet tall and 20 feet wide, but it grows considerably smaller in South Texas, where it's some- what difficult to establish. Hardy to 20F. Does best in moist, fertile soil but will tolerate many types; good beach plant, as it takes sandy soil and salt spray. Manage- able size and attractive shape make this plant a favorite with homeowners and garden designers. Subject to 'frizzle top' in manganese-deficient soil. Fertilize twice a year with slow-release palm fertilizer.
