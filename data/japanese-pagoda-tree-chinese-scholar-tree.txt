Native to eastern Asia. Spreading growth to 5075 feet high and wide. Young wood is smooth, dark gray-green. Old branches and trunk gradually take on rugged look of oak. Dark green, 6- to 10 inches leaves are divided into 7 to 17 oval leaflets, each 12 inches long; undistinguished yellow fall color. Small, yellowish white flowers are carried in branched, foot-long sprays in summer. Pods 2312 inches long are narrowed between big seeds for a bead necklace effect. Dropping seeds can be messy and stain pavement. Takes heat, drought, city conditions. 'Regent' is an exceptionally vigorous, uniform grower; 'Princeton Upright' is similar but more erect. 'Pendulum', to 1525 feet high and wide, has weeping branches. Spreading forms are good shade trees, though stains from flowers and pods may be a problem on paved surfaces and parked cars. Formerly known as Sophora japonica.
