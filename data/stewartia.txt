These slow-growing plants are all-season performers that show off fresh green leaves in spring, white flowers resembling single camellias in summer, and colorful foliage in fall. Winter reveals a distinctive pattern of bare branches and smooth bark that flakes off in varying degrees, depending on species. All grow best in well-drained, acid soil with lots of organic matter. Good in woodland gardens and as foreground specimens against a backdrop of larger, darker-leafed trees.
