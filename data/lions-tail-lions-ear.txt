These showy members of the mint family include both annuals and tender shrubs. Most are native to South Africa. Fuzzy, square stems carry opposite pairs of narrow, pointed, toothed, 2- to 5 inches-long leaves. Bloom comes from summer through fall, when dense, ball-shaped, whorled flower clusters to 4 inches across appear at regular intervals up  and down the stems. Each cluster is composed of deep orange, tubular, 2 inches flowers that are covered with fine hairs. The plants attract butterflies and hummingbirds; deer don't seem to care for them.
