This is a small and relatively unknown group of shrubs  native to eastern North America. Spreading by suckers, they are suitable for massing or as a ground cover. Oval, pointed leaves make an attractive backdrop for summertime clusters of small yellow flow- ers that look something like honeysuckle (Lonicera) blooms. Tough, hardy, and pest free;  cut back in early spring to  renew vigor. Not browsed  by deer.
