These North America native plants have many fine qualitiesbut common name notwithstanding, obedience isn't one of them: Most are notoriously invasive when growing in moist, fertile soil. Keep that in mind when choosing a site, and don't let them spread into wild areas. Slender, upright stems carry medium green, oblong, 3- to 5 inches leaves with toothed edges and pointed tips. Dense spikes of funnel-shaped, 1 inches flowers in pink, rose, white, or lavender top the stems. Blossoms resemble snapdragons (hence the name false dragonhead) and remain in place if pushed or twisted out of position (hence obedient plant). Long-lasting cut flowers.Spiky form makes these plants useful in composing borders. Combine with summer phlox (Phlox paniculata), asters, patrinia, Japanese anemone (Anemone hybrida), false aster (Boltonia). Tall bloom stalks may need staking. Cut to ground after bloom; divide every two years to keep plants in bounds.
