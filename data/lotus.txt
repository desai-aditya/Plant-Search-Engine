Huge, round leaves attached at their centers to leafstalks rise above the water. Large, fragrant summer flowers form above or below leaves. Ornamental, woody fruit is perforated like a saltshaker and looks attractive in dried arrangements. Do not introduce into natural bodies of water, as plants can quickly cover the surface.If you buy started plants in containers, put them in a pond, positioned so soil in pots is 810 inches below surface of water. If you acquire roots, plant them in spring, setting them horizontally and about 4 inches deep in a 1- to 112 feet-deep container of fairly rich soil; then place container at the recommended depth in pond, as described above for started plants. Do not let roots freeze; where freezes are possible, cover the pond or fill it deeper with water. Beware of introducing lotus plants or roots into earth-bottomed ponds 34 feet or shallower; plants will eventually fill in pond, and rhizomes are difficult to remove. Lotus also spreads via floating seeds.
