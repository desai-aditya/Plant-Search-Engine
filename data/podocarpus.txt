Versatile plants grown for their good-looking foliage and interesting form. They are adaptable to many climates and have many uses. Make good screens and background plants. Foliage generally resembles that of related  (Taxus), but leaves of the better-known species are longer, broader, and lighter in color. If a male plant is growing nearby, female plants bear fruit after many years, producing small, fleshy fruit rather than cones. Grow well (if slowly) in most soils but may develop chlorosis (yellow leaves with green veins) where soil is alkaline. Tolerate salt spray and resist pests. Not browsed by deer.Method of propagation determines growth habit. If grown from seed, plants are upright even when young (and stay that way); these plants are usually sold as Podocarpus gracilior. In youth, they have branches set somewhat sparsely with glossy, dark green leaves 24 inches long, inches wide. With age, they produce 1- to 2 inches., soft grayish green to bluish green leaves that are more closely spaced on branches. Stake seedling plants until a strong trunk develops.If grown from cuttings or grafts of a mature tree, plants have the smaller, more closely set leaves just described, but they have very limber branches and are often reluctant to make strong vertical growth. These more willowy plants, suitable for espalier, hanging pots, or growing as vines along fences, are often sold as Podocarpus elongatus. Given staking and tying, Podocarpus elongatus types eventually become upright trees, though their foliage mass persists in drooping for some time. An exception is Podocarpus 'Icee Blue', which has striking blue-gray foliage and shrubby, upright growth to 25 feet tall and wide.
