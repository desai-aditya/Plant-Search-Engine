Creeping perennial that forms low (2- to 3 inches.), widely spreading mounds of tiny oval leaves. Flowers appear singly on 2- to  212 inches stalks in late spring. The 12 inches-wide, four-lobed flowers are pale blue (sometimes white) with a yellow eye. Although small, they are profuse enough to create a charming effect. Use in woodland gardens, around stepping stones, or as carpet for large potted shrubs like camellia or aucuba. Needs acid soil. In the wild, thrives among mosses in light shade under tall oak trees. Will also grow in sparse lawns. Formerly known as Hedyotis caerulea.
