These natives of Mexico and Cen- tral America provide color through- out warm months; use them in small beds, as formal edging for borders, along paths, in contain- ers. Flowers attract hummingbirds. Pinch tips of shoots for compact growth; severely cut back older plants in late fall or early spring. Reliably perennial only in frost-free areas, but may survive light frosts in Coastal South. Easy to grow from cuttings.
