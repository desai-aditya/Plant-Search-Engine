These Mexican natives are spectacular vines for milder climates, reaching heights of 2030 feet Glossy leaves consist of two leaflets with a central, three-part tendril that plants use for climbing. All bear long-lasting, trumpet-shaped flowers. Plant in good, well-drained soil; provide sturdy support, since growth is dense and heavy. Prune in winter to thin stems, control size. Not browsed by deer.
