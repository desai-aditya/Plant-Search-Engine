Native to mountains of medium and high deserts of California, west to Edwards Plateau and Trans-Pecos regions of Texas, and northern Mexico. Grows 46 feet tall, 5 feet wide, with straw-colored branches and flaky bark. Small, lobed leaves are deep green on top, rusty beneath; carried in clusters. Flowers resembling single white roses just 112 inches wide bloom in spring, summer. Large, showy clusters of feathery seed heads  follow, creating a soft haze through which you can see the shrub's rigid branch pattern; they are greenish at first, then later turn pink or take on a reddish tinge. Needs gritty, well-drained soil. Pruning usually not needed. Reseeds freely, which makes it good for naturalized areas but a problem in formal beds. Not for areas with high rainfall, heavy soil. Deer resistant.
