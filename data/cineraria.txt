Most common are large-flowered dwarf kinds, usually sold as Multiflora Nana or Hybrida Grandiflora. These are compact growers (to 1215 inches high and wide) bearing broad clusters of 3- to 5 inches daisies; colors range from white through pink and purplish red to blue and purple, often with contrasting eyes or bands. You'll usually find plants for sale in garden centers and supermarkets between Valentine's Day and Easter. Give them moist, cool, loose, rich soil. Once they finish blooming, throw them away. Formerly known as Senecio x hybridus.
