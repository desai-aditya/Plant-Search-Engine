Native to the coastal marshes  of the Southeast, this upright, free-flowering mallow deserves much wider use in gardens. Breaking dormancy in late spring, it sends up thick stems in a cluster that may reach 5 feet tall and 2 feet wide. Foliage is light green and fuzzy; lower leaves on stems are  6 inches long, with three to five lobes, while upper ones are smaller, either triangular or arrow shaped. Hundreds of pink, 2 inches-wide flowers resembling those of hibiscus smother the plant from midsummer to fall. Seashore mallow thrives in swampy soil and even standing water but adapts to regular garden soil as well. 'Immaculate' features large white blooms. 'Ace Basin' has  rich pink blooms.
