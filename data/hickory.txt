These large, grand, picturesque hardwoods combine long life with handsome bark and colorful fall foliage. Many forms of wildlife depend on the nuts for food. Unfortunately, hickories are seldom sold, because long taproots make them hard to transplant. But if hickories grow on your property, by all means conserve them. Leaves divided featherwise into leaflets. Inconspicuous flowers are followed by nuts enclosed in husks that usually break away at maturity. Trees are too large for smaller yards but are attractive where space is available. All develop deep taproots, so they should be planted while young and not moved later.
