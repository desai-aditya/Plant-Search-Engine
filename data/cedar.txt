These conifers, the true cedars, are stately specimen trees that look best when given plenty of room. Needles are borne in tufted clusters. Cone scales, like those of firs (Abies), fall from the tree, leaving a spiky core behind. Male catkins produce prodigious amounts of pollen that may cover you with yellow dust on a windy day. Plant in deep, well-drained soil. All species are deep rooted and drought tolerant once established.Selections include 'Aurea', needles with yellowish tint;  'Fastigiata', upright, with blue-green needles; 'Glauca', silvery blue; 'Glauca Pendula', weeping form with blue needles; 'Pendula', vertically drooping branches. Untrained, spreading, informally branching plants are sold as  rustics. All types stand up well to hot, humid weather.Although deodars sold by garden centers are very similar in form, many variations occur in a group of seedlingsfrom scarecrowlike forms to compact, low shrubs. Needles, to 2 inches long, may be green or have a blue, gray, or yellow cast. Seed-grown 'Shalimar', an extra-hardy selection that has survived to 15F, has good blue-green color and is the best choice for the Upper South. The following three variations are propagated by cuttings or grafting: 'Aurea', with yellow new foliage turning golden green in summer; 'Descanso Dwarf' ('Compacta'), a slow-growing form reaching 15 feet in 20 years; and 'Pendula' ('Prostrata'), which grows flat on the ground or will drape over rocks or walls. Other popular low-growing forms  include 'Feelin' Blue' (2 feet high,  6 feet wide), 'Prostrate Beauty' (2 feet high, 8 feet wide), and 'White Imp' (3 feet high and wide, with white new growth.)
