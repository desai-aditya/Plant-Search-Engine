Primroses form tufts of foliage, above which rise flowering stems carrying showy, circular, five-petaled blossoms in late winter and spring. The blooms may come on individual stems, in clusters at stem ends, or in tiered clusters like candelabra up the stem.Most primroses are native to the Himalayas and cool regions of southeast Asia and Europe, so they thrive with a combina- tion of moist, rich soil and cool, humid air. Few areas in the South supply these conditions. While most primroses listed below will grow as perennials in the zones indicated, many of them are best treated as cool-weather annuals.
