Vast and varied group (nearly 300 species) encompassing trailers, creeping or tufted miniatures, and erect kinds 16 feet tall. Native throughout the Northern Hemisphere; species described here are perennials mostly from southern Europe, Turkey, the Caucasus, and northern Asia. Flowers are generally bell shaped, but some are star shaped, cup shaped, or round and flat. Usually blue, lavender, violet, purple, or white; some pink.Uses are as varied as the plants. Gemlike miniatures deserve special settingsclose-up  situations in rock gardens, niches in dry walls, raised beds, containers. Trailing kinds are ideal for hanging pots or baskets, wall crevices; vigorous, spreading growers serve well as ground  covers. Upright growers are valuable in borders, for cutting, occasionally in containers.In general, campanulas grow better in good, well-drained soil and the cooler climates of the Upper and Middle South. Most species are fairly easy to grow from seed sown in flats in spring or early summer, then transplanted to the garden in fall for bloom the following year; also may be increased by cuttings or divisions. Divide clumps in falltypically every 3 or 4 years, though some may need yearly division.
