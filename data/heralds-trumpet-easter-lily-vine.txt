From the Himalayas. Rampant vine with arching, twining branches; climbs as high as 30 feet and spreads just as wide. Large (6- to 9 inches.), oval to roundish dark green leaves, smooth and shiny above, slightly downy beneath, give lush tropical look. From spring through summer, bears fragrant, trumpet-shaped, 5 inches-long, green-veined white blossoms that look like Easter lilies (Lilium longiflorum).Does best in well-drained soil enriched with organic matter; regular feeding produces most lavish display of foliage and flowers. Prune after bloom to shape or limit size; flowers are produced on wood 2 years old or older, so keep a good proportion of old wood. Hardy to 28F. Frost kills the vine to the ground, but it usually comes back from the roots. Use as big espalier on warm, wind-sheltered wall or train along eaves of house; sturdy supports are essential, since growth is heavy. Good choice for planting near swimming pools.
