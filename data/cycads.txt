Neither ferns nor palms, these evergreen plants are primitive, cone-bearing relatives of conifers, excellent for tropical effects. A rosette of dark green, feathery leaves grows from a central  point at the top of a single trunk (sometimes several trunks). Eventually as wide as tall. Female plants bear conspicuous, egg- shaped, red-to-orange seeds. Plants can be propagated (best done in spring) either from  seed or by separating offsets  that sprout near the base.
