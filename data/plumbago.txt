These durable plants are valued for their clusters of intense blue, phloxlike flowers that bloom in summer to late fall, when cool hues in the garden are most welcome. (For pale blue flowered Cape plumbago, see Plumbago auriculata.) Tolerate inconsistent watering. Not browsed by deer. Shrubby species are usually treated like perennials in colder zones; cut them back after bloom, and mulch heavily.Dwarf plumbago is semievergreen only in the mildest-winter areas; best to cut back after bloom. Dies back elsewhere; leafs out late in spring. When plants show signs of aging, remove old crowns and replace with rooted stems.
