Native to moist places from the British Isles to Siberia, south to  the Caucasus and Turkey; resents dry, alkaline conditions. Long lived but slow growing, taking several years to reach full size. Erect, narrow, light green leaves form a neat, dense clump. In summer, spikelike clusters of yellowish to purplish flowers rise above clump; they age to tan and last well into fall. Wispy flowers give clump a see-through quality. Good cut flowers. In late fall, both leaves and flower clusters detach from plant's base, leaving nothing visible above ground. Set out  new plantings in spring. There are two forms of moor grass, each with several selections. They bloom better in the Upper and Middle South.
