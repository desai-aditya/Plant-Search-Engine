The name African daisy can refer to any of several plants from southern Africa, and identities are often confused, even by many seed companies and nurseries. Arctotis species have lobed leaves that are rough, hairy, or woolly; their blossoms usually sport a contrasting ring of color around a central eye. Dimorphotheca species have smooth green foliage; their ringless flowers either are white or fall into the yellow-salmon-orange range. Woody, shrubby, white, yellow, or purple African daisies and the trailing types used as ground cover belong to the genus Osteospermum.Seedlings begin blooming about 3 months after germination. They are grown as summer annuals in most of the South but may be used for winter color in Florida and South Texas. The blossoms make good cut flowers, even though they close at night. Plants reseed readily.
