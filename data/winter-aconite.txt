Native to Europe, Asia. Charming plant that reaches 28 inches high, blooming in late winter or early spring. Single yellow flowers resembling buttercups are about 1 inches wide, with five to nine petal-like sepals; each bloom sits on a single, deeply lobed, bright green leaf that looks like a ruff. Immediately after the flowers bloom, round basal leaves divided into narrow lobes emerge; all traces of the plant have vanished by the time summer arrives. The species E. cilicica is similar but blooms later, bears slightly larger flowers, and has bronze-tinted new leaves. Not browsed by deer.Plant tubers in late summer; if they look dry or shriveled, plump them up in wet sand before planting. Plant 3 inches deep and 4 inches apart in moist, porous soil. Reduce water in summer but don't let soil dry out completely. Divide clumps infrequently; when doing so, separate into small clumps rather than single tubers.
