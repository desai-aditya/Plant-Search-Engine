Late-summer flowers from a shrub are rarebut this one fills the void. It forms a spreading, fountain-shaped mass 6 feet tall and 10 feet wide, with arching branches clothed in blue-green leaves composed of three leaflets. Drooping, 6 inches clusters of showy, sweet peashaped flowers appear in late summer and fall. Tolerates hot, dry conditions and infertile soil. Good drainage is a must. Cut plant to within a few inches of the ground in late winter; it will regrow rapidly and bear multitudes of blooms on the new growth. Recommended selections include white-flowered 'Avalanche', with cascading habit; purple-and-white 'Edo-Shibori'; rosy purple 'Gibraltar'; pink 'Pink Fountain', with cascading habit; beautifly white variegated and magenta-blooming 'Spilt Milk'; and white-blossomed 'White Fountain', with weeping form.
