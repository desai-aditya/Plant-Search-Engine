Formerly known as E. grandiflora. Native to the Andes of Colombia and Peru, this evergreen plant combines handsome, glossy, deep green foliage with showy, sweet-smelling flowers. It forms  a cluster of short-stemmed, broadly oval leaves with pointed tips; leaves are about 1 feet long, and foliage mass reaches 12 feet high and wide. In late winter or early spring, a leafless stalk rises above the leaves, carrying up to six nodding white flowers that look something like daffodils. Older plants may stay in bloom for 6 weeks. 'Christine' is more compact than the species.Eucharist lily is very tender and can be grown in the ground only in south Florida and south Texas, where it should be sited in full shade. Even there, it does better in a pot, as plants bloom more heavily when pot bound; plant four or five bulbs in a 6 inches pot. Indoors, mist frequently (leaves but not flowers) and give bright filtered light. Let the soil go slightly dry between waterings. Gradually reduce watering in fall and winter, but don't let plants dry out completely. Feed with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizerevery other week in spring and summer, once a month in fall. In winter, cease fertilizing; this encourages formation of flower buds. When new leaves appear, resume regular watering and fertilizing schedule. Check foliage frequently for scale, which is a common pest; treat with horticultural oil.
