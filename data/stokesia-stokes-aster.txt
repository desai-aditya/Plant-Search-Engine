Native to the Southeast. Rugged and very adaptable; one of the best perennials for Florida. Semievergreen in the Upper South, evergreen elsewhere. Grows 1122 feet high, 112 feet wide, with stiff, erect, much-branched stems. Smooth, firm-textured, medium green leaves are 28 inches long, sometimes toothed at the base. Blooms from May to September. Leafy, curved, finely toothed bracts surround the tight flower buds, which open to 3- to 4 inches-wide, asterlike blossoms in blue, purple, white, or yellow. Each flower consists of a central button of small florets surrounded by a ring of larger rays. Choices include these favorite selections, all of which grow a little taller than wide.
