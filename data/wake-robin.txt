If you asked folks to name their favorite wildflowers, these charming woodland plants would rank high on many lists. They bloom in early spring and need some winter chill. Each stem is topped with a whorl of three leaves; from center of these rises a single flower with three petals. Plant the thick, deep-growing, fleshy rhizomes in a shady, woodsy site. Left undisturbed, they will gradually increase. Plants die to the ground in mid- to late summer. In addition to species listed below, many others are offered by specialists in native plants. Browsing deer often pass trilliums by.
