Yuccas grow over much of North America; hardiness depends on species. All have tough, sword- shaped leaves and large clusters of white or whitish, rounded to bell-shaped flowers. Some are stemless, while others reach tree size. Best in well-drained soil.Taller kinds make striking silhouettes, and even stemless species provide important vertical effects when in bloom. Some have stiff, sharp-pointed leaves; keep these away from walks, terraces, and other well-traveled areas. Yuccas are not usually browsed by deer.Young plants of some species can be used as indoor plants; they withstand the dry indoor atmosphere and will grow well near hot, sunny windows. Give moderate water; feed monthly during growth with a balanced liquid fertilizer. Buy 1-gallon size or smaller; set out in ground when plants become too large for indoors. Successful indoors are Yucca aloifolia (but beware of sharp-pointed leaves), Yucca elephantipes, Yucca filamentosa, Yucca gloriosa, and Yucca recurvifolia.
