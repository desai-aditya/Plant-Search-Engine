Few plants in recent years have seen as many new introductions with such dazzling new colors as Heuchera. These refined, well-behaved plants offer both attractive bell-shaped blossoms and handsome evergreen foliage. Slender, wiry, 1- to 212 feet stems bear loose clusters of nodding flowers that are typically no more than 18 inches across. These dainty blooms, which often lack petals, make an interesting and long-lasting addition to arrangements; they also attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. Colors include carmine, crimson, red, coral, rose, pink, greenish, pale yellow, and white. Most bloom in spring and late summer, and some continue into fall. Leaves are roundish, with scalloped or ruffled edges; colors run the gamut from yellow and orange to red, purple, and brown. Most recent introductions are grown more for fancy foliage than for flowers.Use Heuchera in combination with other perennials in mixed borders; try them in rock gardens and in sweeping masses. Selections with light-colored foliage can brighten a shady spot. All excel in containers, actually growing better than in the ground in most cases.These plants require well-drained soil containing lots of organic matter, such as compost. Divide clumps every 2 to 3 years in spring or fall. Replant vigorous rooted divisions; discard older, woody portions. Can also be started from dust-like seed sown in spring. Watch out for mealybugs, which sometimes infest plants near the base and even on the roots; control with regular applications of insecticidal soap. Black vine weevils can cause much damage; look for notched leaf edges in summer and C-shaped white grubs below the soil line in fall and winter. These grubs chew through the base of the plant (detached crowns can be rerooted in fresh soil). Scalding water poured over the grubs is a good organic control. Rust may occur; remove and dispose of infected leaves.
