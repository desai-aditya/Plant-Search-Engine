Handsome clumps of dainty, divided leaves like those of bleed- ing heart (Dicentra, to which it is closely related) or maidenhair fern (Adiantum). Clusters of small, spurred flowers. Plant in rich, moist soil. Effective in rock crevices, in open woodland, near pool or streamside. Divide clumps or sow seed in spring or fall. Plants self-sow. Summer-flowering species may stop flowering during hottest months; keep soil moist to encourage some continued bloom.
