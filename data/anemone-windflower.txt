A rich and varied group of plants ranging in size from alpine rock garden miniatures to tall Japanese anemones grown in borders; bloom extends from very early spring to fall, depending on species. Seldom browsed by deer.Many named selections of Japanese anemone are available, including the following.Plant tubers scarred side up (look for depressed scar left by base of last year's stem), setting them 12 inches deep and 812 inches apart in rich, light, well-drained loam. Or start in flats of damp sand; set out in garden when stems are a few inches tall. Keep soil moist during growth and bloom. Protect from birds until leaves toughen. In high-rainfall areas, excess moisture induces rot. Tuberous types best treated as annuals in much of the South, since they tend to be short lived where summers are rainy or winters are warm. Tuberous anemones make good container plants.
