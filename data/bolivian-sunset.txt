Hailing from Bolivia and Peru, this tender beauty is usually grown as a houseplantthough it is hardy enough to grow outdoors in the Coastal and Tropical South. A single stem rises to 12 feet., clothed in narrow, pointed, dark green leaves to 6 inches long. From late summer into winter, slender stems rise from the upper leaf joints, bearing tubular, nodding flowers about 1 inches long. Blossoms are orange-red with a golden interior and seem to glow from within. For other plants often called gloxinia, see Sinningia.Indoors, plant in regular potting mix and water only when soil is dry to the touch. Feed monthly with half-strength general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer during active growth. After bloom, stop fertilizing and reduce watering until spring. Outdoors, grow in fairly moist, humus-rich soil in dappled shade or morning sun.
