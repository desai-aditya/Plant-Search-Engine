Every garden needs its share of bold foliage, and no foliage is bolder than that of elephant's ear. Most Southerners are familiar with the common green-leafed variety of this tropical Asian plant, but many new and exciting forms are making their way to the marketplace. Growing from large tubers, these perennials attain enormous sizesome reach 8 feet or tallerwith leathery, heart- shaped leaves that may reach 1 by 3 feet Flowers resemble giant callas (Zantedeschia) but seldom appear. Some elephant's ears form a single clump; others spread.Elephant's ears are effective with tree ferns and other large-leafed tropical plants; they're also good in pots or when massed to create a quickif temporaryscreen. Try combining dark-foliaged selections with yellow-  or green-leafed plants. Not browsed by deer.Choose a planting spot protected from strong wind, which tears leaves. Plant in soil enriched with lots of organic matter, and be sure to provide plenty of moisture (plants thrive in boggy conditions or even standing water). Set tubers about 2 inches deep and 11 feet apart. Plants grow rapidly in hot, rainy weather, especially when given light applications of fertilizer monthly during growth. Tubers are hardy in the Lower, Coastal, and Tropical South; tops die to the ground with the first frost, then reappear in spring. Elsewhere, dig tubers in fall and store them over winter.
