Trumpet trees are vntive to the tropical Americas. Showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are borne in rounded clusters that become larger and more profuse as trees mature. Leaves are typically green; may be simple (undivided) or divided into as many as seven leaflets arranged like fingers of hand. Number of leaflets is often variable within a species.These trees tend to be gangly or irregular when young; benefit from training in early years. Need well-drained soil; respond well to regular fertilizing. All are useful as color accents and as stand-alone flowering trees for display. Larger types are excellent as street or park plantings; smaller species make beautiful patio trees or container plants.
