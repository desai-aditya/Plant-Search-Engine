This heat-loving plant is native from Texas to Florida and Mexico. Mounding growth to 1 feet high,  112 feet wide. Divided, threadlike leaves make a dark green back- ground for flowers that look  like tiny golden marguerites (Anthemis). Use for mass display or pockets of color. Blooms from early summer to fall. In warm-winter areas, can be planted in fall for winter-to-spring bloom. Quick and easy to start from seed planted in flats or sown in place. Not particular about soil type but must have good drainage. When plants become ragged with age, pull them out.
