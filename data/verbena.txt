This large group includes some of the garden's most colorful, useful, and easy-to-grow plants. Most bear clusters of small, five- petaled, tubular blossoms from late spring until frost. Low verbenas make good ground covers and edging plants; they're also great in hanging baskets and containers or tumbling over rock walls. Use taller types in borders. Most thrive in heat and tolerate drought. Provide good air circulation and well-drained soil. Not favored by deer.
