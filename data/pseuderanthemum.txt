Group of about 60 species from tropical woodlands in many parts of the world. Of the two discussed here, one is grown for its colorful leaves, the other for its showy flowers. Plants thrive in fertile, well-drained soil free from nematodes. In areas where they aren't hardy, they make excellent container plants for deck, porch, or greenhouse. If you grow them in pots, give bright light (with protection from hot afternoon sun); let soil dry out somewhat between soakings, and feed monthly during active growth with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer.
