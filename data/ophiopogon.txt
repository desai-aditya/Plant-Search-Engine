It's hard to imagine more serviceable ground covers for shade than these Asian natives. Though slightly less cold hardy than their Liriope cousins (see page 416), they're just as care- free, needing little more than well-drained soil and shelter from hot sun. Deer don't generally bother them. Plant them in large sweeps in areas where you don't want to mow or under large trees where grass won't grow. They also do well in containers. Use them for their lush evergreen foliage; the summer flowers, borne on short spikes, are largely hidden by the leaves.It's easy to obtain more plants by division. Use a sharp spade to divide clumps in early spring; or use a knife to divide clumps sold in flats or cell-packs at garden centers. To get divisions of mondo grass (Ophiopogon japonicus, Ophiopogon planiscapus 'Nigrescens') off to a fast start, trim the roots back by half before replanting. This encourages rapid root growth.
