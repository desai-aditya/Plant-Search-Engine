Native to eastern and midwestern U.S. The false indigos somewhat resemble lupines (Lupinus), but they have deep taproots that enable them to survive difficult conditions. They are long-lived plants that become large clumps with many stems and bloom spikes. They resent transplanting once established. Bluish green leaves are divided into three leaflets. Flower spikes to 1 feet long top the plants in late spring or early summer. Flowers resemble small  and are followed by inflated seedpods; both flowers and pods are interesting in arrangements. Remove spent flowers to encourage repeat bloom. Not usually damaged by deer.
