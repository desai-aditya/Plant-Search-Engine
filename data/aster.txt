Asters range from alpine kinds forming compact, 6 inches mounds to open-branching plants 6 feet tall. Flowers come in white or shades of blue, red, pink, lavender, or purple, mostly with yellow centers; they bloom in late summer to early fall, except as noted. Taller asters are invaluable for abundant color in large borders or among shrubs. Large sprays are effective in arrangements. Compact dwarf or cushion types make tidy edgings, mounds of color in rock gardens, good container plants. For the common annual or China aster sold at nurseries, see Callistephus chinensis. For Stokes' aster, see Stokesia laevis. Recent botanical reclassification means new names for many garden asters, as you will see below.True asters are adapted to most soils, but growth is most luxuriant in fertile soil. Few problems except for mildew on leaves in late fall. Seldom browsed by deer. Divide in late fall or early spring. Replant vigorous young divisions from outside of clump; discard old center.
