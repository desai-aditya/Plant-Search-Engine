This large group of magnificent flowering trees includes species native to the South as well as many imported from Asia. They range in size from shrubby to enormous. Some are evergreen, while most are deciduous. Showy flowers appear in late winter, spring, or summer. Colors include white, pink, rose, red, purple, yellow, and coral. Many are powerfully fragrant. New selections and hybrids arrive every year. You'll find many at local nurseries, but mail-order nurseries have a wider selection.A smaller Southern native, sweet bay (Magnolia virginiana) is easier to fit into most gardens. Though mostly deciduous in the Upper and Middle South, it's evergreen in the Lower and Coastal South and more cold hardy than Magnolia grandiflora.New entries to this group are plants previously listed under the genus Michelia. These trees and shrubs hail from China and the Himalayas and are generally less cold hardy than other evergreen magnolias. They're renowned for their profuse, wonderfully fragrant flowers, which are borne among their leaves as opposed to the ends of the branches.A drawback to spring bloomers in the South is that some, principally Magnolia denudata, Magnolia stellata, and Magnolia x soulangiana, bloom so early during mild winters that late freezes brown and kill the flowers. When shopping for selections of these species, choose those that bloom later in spring. See notes in the descriptions for the ones that do. Magnolia acumina, Magnolia macrophylla, and Magnolia tripetala are native to the South.Slow growing, shrubby to 10 feet tall and 20 feet wide. Use for borders, entryway gardens, edge of woods. Plant this early bloomer where you can see flowers from indoors. Quite hardy, but flowers often nipped by frost in colder part of range. Fine texture in twig, leaf. Fair yellow-and-brown fall leaf color.
