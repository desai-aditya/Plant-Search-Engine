The annual vegetables in this large group are the mainstays of stir-fry dishes and excellent in salads. Asian greens are primarily quick-maturing, cool-season crops that are planted at the same time as other cool-season vegetables: late winter to early spring for spring-to-summer harvest, late summer to early fall for fall and winter harvest.Many Asian greens, especially the mustards, are attractive foliage plants that make a colorful addition to the vegetable garden and also look good mixed with flowering annuals and spring bulbs.Listed here are some of the most common Asian greens; specialty seed catalogs may carry additional kinds. For planting depth and row spacing, follow the instructions on the seed packet.
