Native to Europe and Asia. These large shrubs or small trees are useful in areas where wind, salt, and poor soil are challenges, as in coastal gardens. Their only demands are sun and good drainage. Tiny, scalelike, light green or bluish leaves are held on airy, arching, reddish branches; in spring or summer, narrow plumes of small pink or rose blooms appear at branch ends. Prune regularly to maintain graceful effect. Locate where plant won't be prominent while out of leaf. These plants have become pests in the arid Southwest, where their greedy roots compete with those of native plants for water. Tamarix gallica is abundant along stream banks in western Oklahoma and Texas. There is much confusion in labeling of tamarisks in nurseries and among botanists.
