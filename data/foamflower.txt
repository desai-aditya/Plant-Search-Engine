Clump-forming plants to about 112 feet tall (in bloom) and 1122 feet wide; spread by rhizomes (and by aboveground runners, in the case of Tiarella cordifolia). Leaves arise directly from rhizomes; they are evergreen but may change color in autumn. Selections with year-round colorful foliage are popular; look for new intro- ductions in addition to those described below. Narrow, erect flower stems carry many small white or pink flowers. Useful in shady rock gardens; make pretty ground covers but will not bear foot traffic. Deer resistant.'Pink Skyrocket. Deeply cut green leaves have deep red veins. Profuse show of large pink flowers.
