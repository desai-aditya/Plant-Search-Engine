Native to China. This is one tree you crow about if it blooms in your garden. In gardens, grows 2040 feet tall, 1225 feet wide, with pyramidal to rounded crown and strong branching pattern. Has clean look in and out of leaf. Roundish to heart-shaped, 3- to 6 inches-long leaves are vivid green. Comes into bloom in spring; general effect is that of white doves resting among green leaves (or handkerchiefs drying on branches). Small, clustered, red-anthered owers are carried between two large white or creamy white bracts of unequal size (one 6 inches long, the other about 4 inches long). Trees often take 10 years to come into ower, then may bloom more heavily in alternate years. No fall color. Brown fruit about the size of golf balls hangs on tree well into winter. Susceptibility to stem canker, anthracnose, and powdery mildew makes it challenging to grow in the South.Plant this tree by itself; it should not compete with other owering trees. Pleasing in front of dark conifers, where vivid green and white stand out.
