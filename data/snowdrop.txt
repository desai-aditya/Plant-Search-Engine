Natives of Europe and Asia Minor; perform best in cold-winter climates. Closely related to and often confused with Leucojum (snowflake), these harbingers of spring are among the first bulbs to bloom as winter ends. Nodding, bell-shaped white flowers are borne one per stalk; inner flower segments are infused or marked with green, while larger outer segments are pure white. Plants have two or three strap-shaped basal leaves. Effective in rock gardens or under flowering shrubs, naturalized in woodland settings, or grown in pots. Not eaten by deer or rodents.Plant in autumn, setting bulbs 34 inches deep and 3 inches apart in moist soil with ample humus. Bulbs prefer year-round moisture. Do not divide often; when division is necessary, do the job when the foliage begins to yellow, right after bloom.
