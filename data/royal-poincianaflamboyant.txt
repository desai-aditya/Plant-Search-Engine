From Madagascar. Flamboyant is the word to describe poinciana. Its large trusses of 4 inches., orange- to-scarlet owers with white markings put on a spectacular display in late spring or early summer. Considered by many the most beautiful of the world's flowering trees. Wide-spreading, umbrella-shaped tree of rapid growth to 30ft. tall and twice as wide. Fernlike leaves, nely cut into many tiny leaets, give ltered shade. Blooms are followed by 2 feet-long black seedpods that hang on bare winter branches. Easy to grow but sensitive to cold.
