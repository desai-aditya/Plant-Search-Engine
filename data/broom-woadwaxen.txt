These twiggy, low-growing shrubs make fine bank or ground covers and are a welcome addition to the rock garden. Good drainage is essential for their survival; they grow well in sandy or gravelly, infertile soils. Showy, sweet pea shaped yellow flowers appear  in spring. Leaves are often small and short lived; green branches give deciduous sorts an ever- green look.
