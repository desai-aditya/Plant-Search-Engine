These thorny trees and shrubs are prized for their brilliant flowers, in colors ranging from pink through red, orange, and yellow that attract hummingbirds and butterflies. The flat, beanlike pods that follow contain poisonous seeds. Leaves have three leaflets and usually drop in fall or winter. E.xbidwillii, Erythrina crista-galli, and Erythrina herbacea are hardy outside the Tropical South. Not browsed by deer.
