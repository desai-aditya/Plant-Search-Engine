Raising Brussels sprouts in the South can be challenginglike their relatives broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower, they need a long, cool growing season to produce firm, tasty, sizable sprouts. But it's well worth the effort, as each plant produces as many as 100 sprouts over a period of 6 to 8 weeks. You can grow both spring and fall crops, but fall crops are much more dependable here. In Florida and the Coastal South, plant in fall for a winter crop. Brussels sprouts can survive occasional hard frosts (the chill even sweetens their flavor), but temperatures below 26F may kill them. Recommended selections include 'Catskill', 'Diablo', 'Jade Cross', 'Long Island Improved', 'Nautic', 'Prince Marvel', and 'Valiant'.
