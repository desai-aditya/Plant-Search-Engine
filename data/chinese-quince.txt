Seldom seen, curious tree, usually 1520 feet high (sometimes taller) and about as wide. Trunk is very attractive, with bark that flakes off to reveal shades of brown, green, and gray. Trunks on old trees are often fluted. Roundish oval, dark green leaves to 4 inches long turn yellow and red in fall. Spring bloom produces a scattering of flowers rather than a showthe pale pink, 1- to 1 inches blossoms are borne singly at ends of year-old twigs. Blossoms are followed by extraordinary fruit: fragrant, yellow, egg-shaped quinces to 7 inches long, weighing over a pound apiece. The fruit can be made into jam. Very susceptible to fireblight in warm, humid areas; control by pruning out damaged wood. Needs acid soil and good drainage.
