Fast growing to 2030 feet and as wide, this tree combines the larger flowers of its Catalpa bignonioides parent with the desert toughness and flower color of Chilopsis linearis, its other parent. Leaves are 45 inches long, an inch wide. Blooms from late spring to fall, bearing clusters of frilly, trumpet-shaped flowers in pink, white, or lavender. 'Pink Dawn' has pink flowers, 'Morning Cloud' white ones. Like catalpa, unusually tolerant of heat, cold, and various soils; even better suited than catalpa to dry, limy soil. Prone to powdery mildew in areas with high humidity. Litter is not a problem, as flowers dry on tree and no seedpods are formed. Tolerates wind.
