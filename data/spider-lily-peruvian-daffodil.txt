Stems rising from leafy clumps bear very fragrant flowers in summer; blooms resemble daffodils in having a center cup, but cup is surrounded by six slender, spidery segments. Deciduous species maintain foliage throughout summer if watered, then die back in fall. Plant in rich, well-drained soilin late fall or early winter in frostless areas, after frosts in other areas. Set bulbs with tips 1 inches below surface; space 1 feet apart. Deciduous sorts can be dug after foliage has yellowed (do not cut off fleshy roots), dried in an inverted position, and stored in open trays in a cool, dark, dry place. These are pest-free plants; deer, squirrels, and voles won't eat them.
