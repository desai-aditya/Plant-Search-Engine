This large family of bromeliads is commonly found throughout Texas, Mexico, and Central and South America. Most are epiphytes (tree dwellers) that depend on rain, dew, and fog for moisture. A few grow in soil. Plants vary greatly in size and appearance. Leaves may be wide, narrow (even hairlike), or sword shaped; they may be twisted or curled. Those with green leaves generally need regular water and filtered light; types with gray- green to bluish foliage need less water and tolerate more sun. Often seen mounted on plaques of wood that are hung on walls, indoors or out; also look good in containers filled with loose, fast-draining potting mix. Let the mix go dry between waterings.
