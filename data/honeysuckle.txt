Most honeysuckles are valued for their clustered or paired, often fragrant flowers. Blossoms are tubular in form. Some have two flaring, unequal lips; others are trumpets or straight tubes, sometimes flaring at the mouth into five equal lobes. Flowers attract hummingbirds, and the red or purple berries that follow provide food for many other kinds of birds. Blossoms typically deepen in color after opening, so clusters contain both pale and darker blooms. Vining species climb by twining and need staking until they are tall enough to reach a trellis or other support. As they grow, they may need to be tied to the support here and there to distribute the branches well.Provide good drainage. Honeysuckles typically need some thinning; ideal time for the job is after bloom. Cut old, straggling honeysuckles to the ground before spring growth begins; they will regrow rapidly. Generally free of serious pests, though aphids sometimes infest them.Deep green, oval leaves to 3 inches long are held on reddish brown stems. Two-lipped, 1 inches-long blossoms age from white to yellow; they are followed by small black berries. Birds eat the berries and spread seeds everywhere. Grows very quickly, especially in the Southeast, and can twine its way to 30 feet.Several selections are cultivated. 'Halliana', the most widely available, resembles the species and is every bit as weedy. It is sometimes used as a bank and ground cover in the Southwest, where it is somewhat less aggressive. 'Aureoreticulata' features green leaves netted with yellow. 'Purpurea' offers purple-tinged green foliage and flowers that are purple-red on the outside, white inside.Although Japanese honeysuckle does a great job of hiding chain link fences, it is seldom appropriate for home gardens. Lonicera xheckrottii and Lonicera periclymenum are just as pretty and far better behaved.
