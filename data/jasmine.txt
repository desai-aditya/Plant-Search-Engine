Think of fragrant plants, and jasmine is one of the first to come to mind. Yet not all jasmines are fragrant; and despite its common name, the intensely sweet Confederate jasmine is not a true jasmine at all, but a member of the genus Trachelospermum.Growth habits of jasmines range from vining to vining-shrubby to decidedly shrubby. True vining types climb by twining stems. Vining shrubs do not twine, but rather put out long, slender, lax stems that must be tied into place if the plants are to function as vines. Otherwise, they'll flop over to make green haystacks of foliage. To grow these plants as shrubs, shorten any shoots that become too long. Only one of the species listed here, Jasminum parkeri, is a true shrub; its dwarf size suits it to rock gardens. Most resist deer.Jasmines grow more rapidly in fertile, well-drained soil and bloom more profusely in sunny sites, but all adapt quite well to less-than-perfect conditions. When plants become tangled or untidy, cut them back heavily just before spring growth begins. Pinch and prune as needed throughout the year to control growth.
