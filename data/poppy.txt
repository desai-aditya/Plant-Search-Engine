Poppies provide bright spring and summer color for borders and cut- ting. Give ordinary, well-drained soil; feed lightly until established. Perennial species tend to be short lived. When using poppies as cut flowers, sear cut stem ends in a flame before placing them in water.Champagne Bubbles series (to 1 feet.) and wind-resistant Wonderland series (to 10 inches.) are widely grown strains. Oregon Rainbow series (to 1520 inches.) produces large (to 8 inches-wide) blooms in pastel colors, including bicolors and picotees, but in the South many buds fail to open.A great many named selections are sold; they bloom in late spring and early summer, then go dormant in midsummer. In all types, new leafy growth appears in fall, lasts over winter, and develops rapidly in spring.Set sprawling perennials such as Symphyotrichum, Gypsophila, or Perovskia nearby to cover bare areas after poppies die down. Plant dormant roots in early spring with tops 3 inches deep; set container-grown plants flush with soil line in fall. Give well-drained soil and make sure air circulation is good. Divide crowded clumps in August, after foliage has died down.Mix seed with an equal amount of fine sand, and broadcast it in fall where plants are to grow. For cut flowers, pick when buds first show color. Remove seed capsules (old flower bases) weekly to prolong the bloom season. Prolific self-sower. Not usually browsed by deer.
