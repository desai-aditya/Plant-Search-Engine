Free-blooming plants with daisy- like owers, the fleabanes are similar to closely related Michaelmas daisy (Aster novi- belgii), except that ower heads have threadlike rays in two or more rows rather than broader rays in a single row. White, pink, lavender, or violet owers, usually with yellow centers, bloom from early summer into fall. Give sandy soil. Cut back after owering to prolong bloom.
