Catalpas are among the few truly deciduous trees that can compete in flower and leaf with subtropical species. They bloom in late spring and summer, bearing large, upright clusters of trumpet-shaped, 2 inches-wide flowers in pure white, striped and marked with yellow and soft brown; flowers are held above large, bold, heart-shaped leaves. Long, bean-shaped seed capsules, sometimes called Indian beans, follow the blossoms.Unusually well adapted to extremes of heat and cold; take any type of soil. Where winds are strong, plant in lee of taller trees or buildings to protect leaves from damage. Some gardeners object to litter of fallen flowers in summer and seed capsules in  autumn. Plants need shaping  while young; they seldom develop  a well-established dominant shoot on their own. Shorten side branches as tree grows. When branching begins at desired height, remove lower branches.For the tree sometimes called desert catalpa, see Chilopsis linearis. Another tree sometimes mistakenly called catalpa is the very similar Paulownia tomentosa (empress tree), with lavender flowers. Paulownia shows flower buds in winter; catalpa does not.
