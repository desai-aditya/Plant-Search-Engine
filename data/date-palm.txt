These feather palms are mostly large trees, though the following list includes two that grow less than 20 feet tall. Trunks are patterned with bases of old leafstalks. Small, yellowish flowers in large, hanging sprays. On female trees, blossoms are followed by clusters of datesbut only if the tree has been in the ground for at least several years and if a male tree is nearby. Dates of Phoenix dactylifera and Phoenix sylvestris are used commercially; those of other species don't have as much edible flesh. Date palms hybridize freely, so buy these trees from a reliable nursery that knows the seed or plant source. Deer seldom bother date palms.
