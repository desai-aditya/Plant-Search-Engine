From eastern U.S. Erect grower  to 57 feet tall, 112 feet wide; resem- bles a very tall Veronica. Stems are clothed with whorls of toothed, 6 inches., lance-shaped,  dark green leaves. Stems branch in the upper portions and are topped by slender, spikelike clusters (to 9 inches long) of tiny  pale blue or white flowers. Useful plant for background in large borders. Makes a striking pattern against dark background, such  as tall hedge or woodland edge, but too much shade makes it floppy. Likes fertile, well-drained, slightly acid soil. Selections with flowers in specific colors, most  of which are somewhat smaller than the species, include white 'Album', reddish purple 'Apollo', soft pink 'Fascination', light lavender 'Lavendelturm', and  rosy pink 'Pink Glow'. 'Adoration' (V. 'Adoration') is upright and shapely, with lavender-pink flowers.
