These easy-to-grow plants from Africa bear spikes of flowers in jewel-like tones of blue, lavender, purple, or red. Each flowering stem bears six or more 2 inches-wide blooms in mid- to late spring. Ribbed, hairy leaves grow in fans.            Plant corms 46 inches deep, 6 inches apartas edging, in a rock garden, or in pots. In the Lower, Coastal, and Tropical South, plant out in fall; in the Upper and Middle South, plant in spring. In the Upper and Middle South, lift and store            corms in fall. Where corms can overwinter in ground, leave them in place; they'll multiply and bloom more profusely each year. Plants get their common name from the fact that baboons like to eat the cormsso don't plant them if            baboons are a problem in your neighborhood.
