Though best known for blackberry and raspberry (see separate entries), the brambles include many ornamental plants, most of them thornless. Those listed here differ from blackberry and raspberry not only in their lack of prickles but also in having perennial rather than biennial stems. Spring flowers are followed by small, edible berries that attract birds. Need good drainage; spread widely by rhizomes. Plant ground cover types about 2 feet apart. Deer seldom bother these plants.
