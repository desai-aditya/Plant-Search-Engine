Probable bigeneric hybrid between an obscure aster and Solidago canadensis. Grows erect to 23 feet tall and 12 feet wide, with sturdy stems holding medium green, lance-shaped leaves to  6 inches long. In late summer or early autumn, sprays of 12 inches., daisylike yellow flowers (wonderful for cutting) appear atop the foliage. Fairly trouble free in well-drained soil, though it can get mildew.  An excellent companion for fall-blooming asters, perennial salvias, and ironweed (Vernonia noveboracensis). 'Lemore' features larger blooms in creamy yellow. Formerly known as Solidago x luteus.
