Plants don't get much stranger than the voodoo lilies. This large group of aroids, mostly from Asia, grows from huge underground cormlike tubers, some weighing up to 100 pounds. In summer, each produces a single inflor- escence that looks like a giant calla (Zantedeschia). A large, hoodlike bract called a spathe surrounds a central spike or finger-shaped spadix. The fragrance this emits is unforgettablethe breath of the Devil but it lasts only for about a day. The carrion stench attracts flies, which are the plant's chief pollinators.After flowering, voodoo lilies rest for about a month before producing a single giant (to 3 feet wide) leaf, which lasts for the rest of the summer. Plants need moist, woodsy, well-drained soil. Set the tubers 4 inches deep in late winter or early spring; apply fertilizer monthly for best results. Often grown in pots or tubs; also good for naturalized areas where neighbors aren't too close.
