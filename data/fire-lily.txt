Native to South Africa, this ever- green member of the amaryllis family offers both spectacular flowers and handsome foliage. It makes an exceptional and long-lived potted plant for indoors or out. In the Tropical South, where it is hardy, it's also a great addition to the mixed border. Blooms dependably in shade.
