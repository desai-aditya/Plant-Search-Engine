There are two kinds of gardeners in the Souththose who have grown tomatoes and those who will grow them. No other crop produces so much for so many for so little expense. Just about everyone swears by his or her own favorite method of growing tomatoes. If yours works, stick with itbut if you're a beginner or dissatisfied with the results you've achieved thus far, the following information should help.First, choose selections adapted to your area. Those listed on the following pages perform well in most of the South. Fine-tune these recommendations by checking with local garden centers and your Cooperative Extension Service. Next, decide whether you want big tomatoes for slicing, meaty ones for canning and sauce, or small ones for popping into your mouth.Factor into the equation when you expect to plant and how long you want to wait for harvest. It's hard to go wrong with midseason types; they ripen fruit anywhere from 60 to 75 days after transplants are set out. But if it's midsummer and you're trying to squeeze in a fall crop before frost, you'll need to plant an early tomato that ripens in 50 to 60 days. Late tomatoes that ripen in 80 to 95 days are best planted in spring.Also consider how much fruit you want and how much space you can devote to your plants. Tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum, native to the Andes) are classified as either determinate or indeterminate. Determinate tomatoes are bushy and ripen all of their fruit over several weeks; they need less space and support than indeterminate types. Indeterminate tomatoes are vinelike and ripen their fruit over a period of months; they give more total fruit but need more space and support.TOMATO SELECTIONSThe following lists offer just a sampling of the incredible number of different tomatoes you can buy as seeds or started plants.
