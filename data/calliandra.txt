Grown as landscape plants in the Coastal and Tropical South and in greenhouses elsewhere, these plants sport feathery foliage and blossoms that look like powder puffs. The showy parts of the flowers are actually long, silky stamens. Prune out any dead, damaged, or unwanted growth immediately following bloom.
