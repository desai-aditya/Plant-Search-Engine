Mainly from Europe, Mediterranean region. Erect plants 28 feet high form low foliage clumps topped by spikes of tubular flowers shaped like fingertips of a glove; colors include purple, yellow, white, pastels. Blossoms attract hummingbirds. Leaves are typically gray-green and hairy. Common foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) is widely grown for height and color display in shaded gardens, but other, less well-known species are deserving subjects for borders, woodland edges, and larger rock gardens. Most tend to be biennials, but some can be coaxed into a second year of bloom if spent flowers are removed before they set seed.Garden strains include Camelot, which reaches 3124 feet tall in sun or shade and blooms consistently the first and second years in shades of rose, white, lavender, or cream with a speckled throat; 5 feet-tall Excelsior, with fuller spikes than species and flowers held more horizontally to show off interior spotting; 3 feet Foxy, which performs as an annual and blooms in 5 months from seed; 4 feet Gloxiniiflora, bearing flowers that are larger and open wider than those of species; 3 feet-high Peloric Mixed, with topmost flower of each spike open or bowl shaped and 3 inches wide; and Shirley, a tall (6 feet), robust strain with a full range of colors.Foxgloves like moist, rich, well-drained soil. Protect the plants from snails and slugs. (Deer leave them alone.) After the first flush of flowers, cut off the main spike; side shoots will develop and bloom late in the season. In the Lower and Coastal South, treat as annuals; set out new transplants in summer and fall for bloom the next spring or summer. In the Upper and Middle South, set out plants or sow seed in spring for bloom the following year. Plants self-sow freely; blooms of volunteers are often white or light colored.
