This South African native looks like a slightly smaller version of the familiar amaryllis (Hippeastrum). Good-looking, strap-shaped evergreen leaves grow to 12 feet long. In summer and early autumn, clusters of bright orange-red, funnel-shaped flowers, each 23 inches wide, appear atop 2 feet-tall stalks. Pink- and white-flowered forms are also available. Will live in the ground year-round in the Coastal and Tropical South; quite tolerant of competition from tree roots. Usually grown in pots, however, since bulbs bloom better when somewhat potbound. Excellent potted plant for the patio or indoors (best with east- or south-facing exposure). Plant in well-drained potting mix in June or July or just after flowering; set bulbs with tips just below soil surface. During active growth, fertilize monthly with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer. Water regularly during summer and fall, but let soil go slightly dry between waterings during semidormant period in winter and spring.
