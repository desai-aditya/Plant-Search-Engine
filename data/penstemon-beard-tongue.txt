Penstemons are beloved for their colorful flowers, but in most areas of the South, they can be problematic to grow. Of the more than 250 species, the majority are native to the West, ranging from Canada to Mexicoand they prefer dry air, cool night temperatures, and excellent drainage, which doesn't sound much like Dixie. Fortunately, there are native Southern species that thrive here naturally; and the hybrids and selections presented here also accept Southern conditions.Most species have narrow, pointed leaves. Narrow, tubular or bell-shaped flowers are typically 34112 inches long and are held in erect clusters. Bright reds and blues are the common colors, but you'll also find blooms in shades of soft pink through salmon and peach to deep rose, lilac, dark purple, white, and yellow. Blossoms attract hummingbirds. Plants are generally short lived (three to four years). All need fast-draining soil.
