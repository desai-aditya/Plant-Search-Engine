Little-used but attractive clan  of shrubs or small trees noted  for both foliage and flowers. Thick, leathery, glossy leaves are anise-scented when crushed; spring flowers have many petal-like segments and are reminiscent of small magnolia blossoms. Fruit that follows are small, one-sided pods arranged in a ring. The star anise of Chinese cookery is the fruit of the tropical tree Illicium verum, apparently not grown in North America. All like rich soil with abundant organic material. Big, bold foliage gives the impression of rhododendrons. Good understory plants for woodland gardens; also useful for screening. Seldom need pruning. Unappealing  to deer.
