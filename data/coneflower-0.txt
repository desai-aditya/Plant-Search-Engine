The showy garden rudbeckias that brighten summer and fall borders are descended from wild plants native mainly to the eastern U.S. All are tough and easy to grow. Blossoms have yellow or orange rays and a raised central cone. Choice cut flowers; cutting also encourages rebloom late in season. Divide perennials when crowded, usually every few years.For front of border, try lower-growing selections 'Goldilocks' (double flowers) and 'Toto', both 810 inches high; Becky Mix (1215 inches.); 'Sonora' (15 inches.); 'Tiger Eye'  (1624 inches high and wide, with unusually profuse bloom), and 'Marmalade' (2 feet.).
