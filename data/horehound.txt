Native to Mediterranean region and western Asia; naturalized throughout Europe and the Americas. Coarse, upright plant to 13 feet tall, 1112 feet wide, with wrinkled, woolly, aromatic, gray-green leaves to 2 inches long. Blooms in second year from seed, bearing rounded whorls of white flowers (similar to those of mint) on foot-long, branching stems in summer. As a garden plant, it is invasive and rather weedy looking, but it makes a serviceable edging in a garden of gray-leafed plants. Used for medicinal purposes and in candy. Foliage lasts well in bouquets. Requires little water but will take more if drainage is good; otherwise not fussy about soil. Give protection from cold and wind.
