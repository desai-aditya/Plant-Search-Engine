Rushes somewhat resemble grasses, with leaflike, cylindrical stems and tiny, inconspicuous flowers clustered near stem tips. Some have a rigid, upright habit; stems of others are twisted into spirals. Specialists usually suggest planting them with grasses or aquatic plants at the edge of a pond or stream, in water, or among stones and pebbles.
