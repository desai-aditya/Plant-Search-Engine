Native to Brazil. For culture and description, see Schlumbergera. Much like S. buckleyi but initially more upright, then semipendent to 6 inches high, 1 feet wide (S. buckleyi is completely pendent). Leaves have hair-like bristles on the tips. Blooms in spring, often again in late summer or early fall. There are many selections, with blossoms in various shades of white, pink and red. Good houseplant; bring outdoors during warm times of year, if desired. Suffers in hot sun. Keep plants cool and moist when in bloom to extend flowering season. 'Sirus' has white flowers. Formerly known as Rhipsalidopsis gaertneri.
