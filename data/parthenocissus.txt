Valued for handsome foliagegreen in summer, reliably turning to superb orange or red shades in fall. Blossoms are insignificant; more noticeable are clusters of small blue-black fruit that forms in late summer or fall and hangs on into winter if not consumed by birds. Vines typically cling to walls by suction disks at ends of tendrils. All but the fairly restrained Parthenocissus henryana are said to grow to 5060 feet., but they are really limited only by the size of the support.These vines thrive in organically enriched soil. Think twice before letting them attach to shingles, clapboard, or mortared brick or stone. At repainting time, the clinging tendrils are hard to remove, and the stems can creep under siding. They also hasten deterioration of wood and mortar. When vines reach desired size, prune each dormant season to restrain spread andfor those trained on buildingsto keep them away from doors, windows, and eaves. Cut out any wayward branches; likewise cut out any that have pulled away from their support, since disks will not reattach. Trim as needed during the growing season.
