The coconut palm is both an economically valuable plant and a handsome ornamental, but it is hardy only in south Florida. Can grow to 80 feet or more but is usually much shorter, with a leaning or curving trunk and a crown of feathery, 20 feet fronds. Flowers are not notable, but the fruit is the coconut of commerce. Sprouted coconuts are seen fairly often in large pots or tubs; such plants are attractive until they grow too large. Grows best near the shore.Landscape use is limited by the risk that falling coconuts pose to passersby and by a potentially fatal plant disease, lethal yellows. For home gardens, dwarf forms such as 10 feet 'Nino' are the wisest choice.
