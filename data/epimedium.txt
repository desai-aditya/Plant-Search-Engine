Low-growing plants that spread by creeping underground stems. Thin, wiry leafstalks hold leathery leaves divided into heart-shaped leaets 34 inches long. Foliage is bronzy pink in spring, green in summer, bronzy in fall. Even in deciduous types, leaves last late into the year. In spring, plants produce loose spikes of small, waxy owers like tiny columbines (Aquilegia) in pink, red, red-orange,  creamy yellow, or white. The owers have four petals, which may be spurred or hooded,  and eight sepalsfour innerones resembling petals and four (usually small) outer ones.Use as ground cover under trees or among rhododendrons, azaleas, camellias; outstanding choice for dry shade. Compete well with surface-rooted trees. Prefer partial shade but tolerate heavy shade. Foliage and owers are long lasting in arrangements. Cut back foliage of semievergreen and deciduous types in late winter before bloom. Divide large clumps in spring or fall by severing tough roots with a sharp spade. Adaptable to containers. Not browsed by deer.
