For many gardeners, the appear- ance of crocus signals the end of winter. Native to the Mediterranean region and the Caucasus, these low-growing plants have grasslike leaves, often with a silvery midrib; the foliage appears before, during, or after bloom, depending on the species. Flowers are 1123 inches long, with flaring or cup-shaped petals. They're available in a wide  range of colors.Most crocus bloom in late winter or earliest spring. Collectively, the earliest bloomers are known as snow crocus. Others bloom in fall, the owers rising from bare earth weeks or days after planting. Mass them for best effect. Lovely in rock gardens, between stepping stones, in containers. Set corms 23 inches deep and 34 inches apart in light, porous soil. Divide every 3 to 4 years. Don't bother planting crocus if your garden has chipmunksthese rodents will dig up and eat every one. Won't naturalize where winters are warm.
