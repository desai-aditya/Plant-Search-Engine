Where space allows, these dense, large shade trees bring lush beauty and delicious nuts into the landscape. They just need to be sited where their litter and rank-smelling pollen won't be too obtrusive. All have handsome dark-to-bright green foliage. Small, creamy white flowers in long (8- to 10 inches.), slim catkins make quite a display in summer. The large edible nuts are enclosed in prickly burs. Nuts fall to the ground when ripe. Gather daily, remove from burs, and dry in the sun (in shade in hot climates). Plant two or more trees to ensure cross-pollination and a substantial crop; single trees bear lightly or not at all. Give occasional deep irrigation.Chestnut blight has made American chestnut (Castanea dentata) nearly extinct in its native range, but other species and hybrids that resist the disease are available.
