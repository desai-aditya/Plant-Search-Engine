Sprawling plants that bloom over a long season, bearing phloxlike clusters of blue or white flowers at branch ends. Prune these shrubs back hard in late winter  to control their growth and keep them compact. For other plants that are called plumbago, see Ceratostigma.Evergreen where frosts are  absent or light; heavy frost can burn new growth and blacken leaves, but recovery is fast. Prune out any damaged parts when frost danger is past. Not fussy about soil type but must have good drainage. Good cover for bank, fence, wall; good background and filler plant. Does very well in pots. Tolerates light salt spray. Not browsed by deer.
