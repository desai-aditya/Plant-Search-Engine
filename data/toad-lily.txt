Woodland plants that resemble false Solomon's seal (Smilacina) in foliage. Interesting, heavily spotted, inch-long flowers appear at leaf joints and in terminal clusters in late summer and fall. They are complex in structure, somewhat orchidlike: Each blossom has three petals and three sepals, with a column of decorative stamens and styles rising from the center. Need soil enriched with plenty of organic matter. Excellent companions to ferns, foamflower (Tiarella), and hostas. Unfortunately (like hostas), they are a favorite snack for voles.
