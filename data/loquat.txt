You know you're in the Deep South when you start seeing loquats. Native to China, these handsome evergreens feature large, glossy, prominently veined foliage. Use them for tall screens or as large container subjects; beautiful when espaliered against a fence or wall. Both of the species listed here produce fruit enjoyed by birds, but only that of Eriobotrya japonica is eaten by people. Loquats thrive in fertile, well-drained soil. They accept heavy pruning. Subject to fireblight, especially if given too much fertilizer. Not bothered by deer.Most trees sold are seedlings; they are good ornamental plants with unpredictable fruit quality. If you denitely want fruit, look for a grafted selection. 'Big Jim' bears large, midseason fruit with yellow flesh and rich, juicy texture. Early-ripening 'Champagne' has yellow-skinned, white-eshed, juicy, tart fruit. Midseason 'Gold Nugget' has sweeter, orange fruit. Early 'MacBeth' has exceptionally large fruit with yellow skin, creamy esh. 'Premiere' has fruit with yellow-orange skin, white flesh, and good flavor born midseason on a compact tree. 'Thales' is a late, yellow-eshed selection.Plant in well-drained soil. In dry climates, it will thrive with no irrigation once established, but it does better in youth with regular moisture. Mulch over root zone. Prune to shape; if you like the fruit, thin branches somewhat to let light into tree's interior. If tree sets fruit heavily, remove some while it's small to increase the size of remaining fruit and to prevent limb breakage. Fireblight is a danger. If leaves and stems blacken from top downward, prune back 1 feet or more into healthy wood. Use as lawn tree; train as espalier on fence or trellis but not in reected heat. Good in container for several years.
