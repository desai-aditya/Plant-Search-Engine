Native to Texas and Mexico, this is one of the finest-textured, softest-looking ornamental grasses. Threadlike, bright green leaves form a clump to 2 feet tall, 23 feet wide. In summer, produces very thin flowering stems that arch outward and downward, ending in a cloud of silvery green inflorescences that age to a light straw color and remain attractive into winter. Especially effective when massed toward the front of a border, on slopes, and beside walkways or pools. It will self-sow, but only enough to provide seedlings to transplant into desired locations. Deer resistant. This plant was formerly known as Stipa tenuissima.
