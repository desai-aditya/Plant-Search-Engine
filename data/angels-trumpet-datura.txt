Together with Brugmansia, this genus forms the showy group of plants known as angel's trumpets. Daturas differ from Brugmansias in several ways, however: they are herbaceous rather than shrublike, their flowers are upright rather than pendent, and their seedpods are swollen and spiny rather than beanlike.Daturas are easy to grow if given fertile, moist, well-drained soil; full sun; and an occasional feeding with a balanced general-purpose houseplant fertilizer. They're easily propagated from seeds, which burst from seed capsules in late summer. Some species reseed rampantly. Where plants aren't winter hardy, store them in a cool greenhouse or unheated garage during cold months.
