Many are native to the West Coast, where they bloom in sunny fields and meadows in spring and early summer, but they also adapt to Midwestern prairies and the Texas Hill Country. Plants sport a few grasslike leaves topped by a cluster of funnel-shaped or tubular, 12- to 2 inches-long blossoms; they die to the ground after blooming. Great choice for rock gardens and dry meadows. Good cut flowers. Many Triteleia species were previously listed as Brodiaea.These plants grow naturally in heavy adobe soil in areas that are rainy in winter and early spring, then dry the rest of the year. If you can't provide a long dry period, be sure to plant in sandy or gritty soil. Set corms 23 inches deep and 24 inches apart.
