From Paraguay and Argentina.  As a shrub, it grows to 812 feet  tall and 610 feet wide. But it can  be staked into a tree form or,  with support, grown as a vine  to 1215 feet or more. Can also be allowed to sprawl as a ground cover. Leaves are bright green, oval; violet-blue, - to 1 inches flowers throughout warm weather, often nearly year- round. Informal, fast growing,  not easy to use in tailored landscapes; prune hard to keep  it neat. In severe cold, leaf drop  is heavy and branch tips may  die back. Not browsed by deer. 'Royal Robe' is more compact  (to 68 feet high and wide),  bears darker purple flowers  over a longer season. 'Variegatum' has green leaves edged in white. Formerly known as Solanum rantonnetii.
