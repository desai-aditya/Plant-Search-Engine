While true fuchsias sulk in hot Southern summers, these South African natives like the weather  just fine. They die to the ground  in winter in the Upper and Middle South but remain shrubby in the Lower South. Plants grow 34 feet high, spreading about as wide  by underground stems or rooting prostrate branches. From sum- mer into fall, plants bear tubu- lar, curved flowers resembling fuchsias in loosely branched clusters. After bloom, cut out  old flower stalks to neaten plants. In the Upper South, mulch  heavily in late fall. Species can be started from seed, but named selections should be grown from cuttings or by layering bottom branches.
