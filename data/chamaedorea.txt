Generally small, slow-growing, feather-type palms from the rain forests of Mexico and Central and South America. Some have single trunks, others clustered trunks; leaves are variable in shape. Perfect for a large container on a shaded patio. If growing indoors, feed monthly during growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer; cut back on fertilizer and water in winter.
