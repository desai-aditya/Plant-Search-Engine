Formerly Kochia scoparia. Native to Eurasia. To 3 feet high and 2 feet wide. Branches are so thickly clothed in soft, narrow, light green leaves that plant is too dense to see through. Grow individually for its gently rounded form; or group plants for low, temporary hedge or edging. Can be sheared into any shape. Grow from seed sown in early spring or (in mild-winter climates) in fall. Seeds need light to germinate, so barely cover them with soil. Tolerates high heat.
