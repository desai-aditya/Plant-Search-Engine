Though it hails from China and Japan, this shrub has become a true Southern passalong plant, often seen gracing older cottage and country gardens. Grows 36 feet tall and somewhat wider, with an open, rounded habit. Bright green, 2- to 4 inches-long, tooth-edged leaves are oval and pointed, with prominent veining; they emerge early in spring and may turn soft lemon-yellow in fall. Showy yellow flowers are single or double, 1142 inches across; they appear mainly in spring but continue sporadically throughout the summer. Flowers are solitary and resemble small rosesin fact, Japanese kerria is sometimes mistakenly called the yellow rose of Texas. In winter, the leafless bright green stems lend welcome color to the garden.Give Japanese kerria room to display its naturally arching form. Use it in mixed borders and in combination with spring- blooming shrubs and bulbs; also striking when massed. Best sited in some shade, as the flowers tend to fade in hot sun. Cut branches are easy to force into early bloom indoors. Flowers dry easilyjust cut branches in full flower, place them in a vase of water, and let the stems gradually absorb the water.

Propagation by division is easy: Use a sharp spade to separate a stem or two from the base of the mother plant in late winter. Or propagate by taking cuttings in summer. Prune heavily after bloom, cutting to the ground older stems that have bloomed. Also remove dead wood and spindly growth.
