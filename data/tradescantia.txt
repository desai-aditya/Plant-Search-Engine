Most are virtually indestructible plants with long, trailing stems. Usually seen in pots or hanging baskets, but can be used as ground coversthough the most vigorous, rambling types can be invasive. On variegated forms, pinch out any growth that reverts to solid green. Deer don't normally browse these plants. Types grown as houseplants should be given bright, indirect light and kept fairly moist; feed them with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer twice a month from spring through fall, once a month in winter.Generally unattractive in winter. Frost may kill tops, but recovery is fast in warm weather. Use as ground cover, for bedding, in pots. Full sun or light shade. Moderate water. Pinch back after bloom. Tradescantia p. 'Variegata' sports dazzling purple, cream, and pink stripes; not quite as cold hardy. 'Blue Sue' has blue-green foliage with a purple margin.
