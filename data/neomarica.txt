Like iris, these old favorites produce fans of lance-shaped leaves that arise from rhizomes. Foliage and flowering stems  grow to about the same height. Flowers are intricate, with three large, rounded outer segments around three smaller, curled inner segments banded in contrasting colors. Each flower lasts only a day, but others follow over an extended period. Indoors, give bright light but protect from hot sun. During active growth, feed monthly with a balanced fertil- izer; let soil go fairly dry between soakings. In winter, stop feeding and give little water.
