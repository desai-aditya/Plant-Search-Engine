Prized since Victorian times for their beautiful foliage, these ferns are very easy to grow. All species described here prefer rich, moist, well-drained soil containing lots of organic matter. They do not tolerate extended summer drought or heavy root competition from trees. Fronds of most types turn brown after repeated frosts; leave the dead foliage on the plants through winter to provide mulch and to shelter the delicate fronds as they emerge in spring. Propagate by dividing clumps in early spring. Deer resistant.
