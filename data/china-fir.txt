This picturesque conifer from China has a heavy trunk; stout, whorled branches; and droop- ing branchlets. It grows at a moderate rate to 30 feet tall with 20 feet spread. Stiff, needlelike, sharp-pointed leaves are 12 inches long, green above and whitish beneath. Its brown, 1- to 2 inches cones are interesting but not profuse. Among palest of needled evergreens in spring  and summer, China fir turns red- bronze in cold winters. Needs protection from hot, dry wind in summer and cold wind in winter. Becomes less attractive as it ages. Branches with dead needles persist, giving tree an unkempt look. Prune them out. 'Glauca', with striking gray-blue foliage, is more widely grown and hardier than the species. The dwarf  'Little Leo' slowly forms a flattened mound of bright  green foliage that turns bronze  to purple in winter.
