The appeal of these small plants lies in subtle beauty, not overwhelming show. They sport charmingly detailed foliage, with thin-stemmed leaves divided into numerous narrow to rounded leaflets. Where hardy (down to 24F), they make nice rock garden plants and ground cover, but they are most popular as houseplants. Indoors, give them good light but protect from midday sun; feed monthly with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer diluted to half-strength.
