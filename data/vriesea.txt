Native to high elevations in Mexico, Central and South America, and the West Indies. Vrieseas combine spectacular, long-lasting flower spikes with the most handsome foliage of any bromeliad. Rosettes of long, leathery leaves may be banded, mottled, or plain. Spear-shaped flower spikes rising from the plant's center may hold their color for months. There are dozens of vrieseas from which to choose, offering a wide range of colors, shapes, and sizes. Hybridization has produced many plants of complex parentage.Vrieseas are epiphytes, naturally growing in the crotches of trees. In the Tropical South (USDA 10-11), you can grow them that way, toojust wrap the plant's base in coarse sphagnum moss and secure it to a tree branch. Mist the moss daily. Elsewhere, grow these bromeliads as potted plants you take in for the winter. Plant in loose, fast-draining potting mix; let the mix go slightly dry between waterings, and mist plants frequently. You can fill the central cup with water occasionally during the warmer months, but do not keep it continuously filled or the plant may rot. Feed with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer diluted to half-strength once a month in spring and summer; don't feed in fall and winter. Indoors or out, place vrieseas where they'll get good light but not hot, direct sun.
