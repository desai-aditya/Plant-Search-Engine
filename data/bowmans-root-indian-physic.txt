This charming woodland wild- flower is native from southern Ontario south to Georgia and Alabama. Grows 23 feet tall and  2 feet wide, with reddish stems  and bronzy green, 2- to 4 inches-long leaves divided into three narrow, toothed leaflets; foliage turns yellow, orange, and red in fall. Panicles of starlike, white or pinkish, 112 inches-wide flowers seem to float above the leaves in late spring and early summer. Red sepals remain after the petals drop. Bark from the thick root  has many uses in traditional medicine. 'Pink Profusion' has flowers of light pink. Plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil loaded with organic matter; a good companion for hostas, ferns, foamflower (Tiarella), false solomon's seal (Polygonatum), and blue phlox. Will self-sow if not deadheaded. Resists deer. Formerly known as Porteranthus trifoliatus.
