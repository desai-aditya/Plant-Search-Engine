Primarily South African natives, the aloes range from 6 inches miniatures to trees; all form clumps of fleshy, pointed leaves and bear branched or unbranched clusters of orange, yellow, cream, or red flowers. Some species bloom nearly every month, but the biggest show comes from midwinter through summer. Leaves may be green or gray-green, often strikingly banded or streaked with contrasting colors. Showy and easy to grow in well-drained soil in reasonably frost-free areas; need little water but can take more. Most tolerate salt spray and are good beach plants. Seldom browsed by deer.Where winters are too cold for all-year outdoor culture, grow aloes in pots and shelter from frosts. Most kinds make outstanding container plants. Highly valued as ornamentals, in the ground or in pots. The aloes listed here are only a few of the many kinds. Sizes given apply to plants grown outdoors in the ground.
