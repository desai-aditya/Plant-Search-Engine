Furry gray foliage is the outstanding characteristic of the pearly everlastings. Most are heat-tolerant, mounding plants with erect, branching stems carrying attractive (though not showy) clusters of papery- textured daisies that may be cut in summer for use in dried arrangements. Since they withstand lower light than most other gray-leafed plants, they're ideal for brightening semishady borders. Not fussy about soil but need reasonably good drainage. Seldom browsed by deer.
