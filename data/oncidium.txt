Orchids native from Florida and Mexico through South America. The several hundred species and countless hybrids range from tiny plants just 1 inches tall to giants with branching flower spikes to 6 feet or more, bearing dozens of blooms. Most produce long spikes of yellow or brown-and-yellow flowers; a few come in white or rose. Some (including the plants described here) have compressed pseudobulbs, while others are almost without pseudobulbs; some have just one or two large leaves, others cylindrical, pencil-like leaves. Plants typically produce a few large blossoms or many small ones, but some have numerous large flowers and a few bear their blooms singly. In many, flowers have a large, flaring lip reminiscent of a flamenco dancer's skirt; these are some- times called dancing ladies. Blossoms of some are scented.As outdoor plants, oncidiums are usually grown on tree trunks or in pots on the patio; indoor plants can be brought outdoors during warm weather.
