The quintessential seaside plants: tolerant of wind, sand, and salt, though tender to frost. Useful for windbreaks. Thick, often picturesquely twisted trunk and branches. New leaves reddish or coppery, mature ones glossy green with reddish veins. Small white owers are followed by clusters of greenish fruits that turn purple when ripe; they can be made into jelly. Shape plant by pruning just before new growth emerges. Small plants in containers can be used for bonsai.
