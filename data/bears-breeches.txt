There is nothing subtle about these plants. Bold and coarse textured, they make a grand statement in any garden. Native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean, they feature large, deeply lobed, sometimes spiny leaves in clumps to about 3 feet wide. The flowers that appear in late spring or summer are a sight to beholdtall spikes of hooded, whitish, rose, or purple blossoms beneath green or purplish bracts.These tough plants have spreading roots and can be invasive in rich soil, so give them plenty of room or confine their roots with a barrier at least 8 inches deep. Extended drought causes the leaves to yellow and wither in summer; deep watering or rain results in a flush of fresh foliage. Plants do fine in shade gardens, where their foliage and flowers combine well with hostas and ferns. They also thrive in drier, sunny spots in the company of daylilies (Hemerocallis), bearded irises, and ornamental grasses. Good drainage is important. Deer resistant.
