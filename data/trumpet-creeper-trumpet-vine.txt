Vigorous climbers used for large-scale effects, quick summer screens. All bear radiant, orange-toned blossoms shaped like flaring trumpets, in clusters at branch tips, midsummer to fall. Glossy leaves are divided into 212 inches., ovate leaflets. Stems have aerial rootlets that cling to wood, brick, stucco, and other surfaces. Unless pruned and tied to supporting surface, old plants can become top heavy and pull away. Each dormant season, shorten some branches and thin others. Pinch back shoot tips in summer to keep plants bushy. Plants spread by suckering roots; pull any that appear. If older plants become unmanageable, cut to ground before spring growth begins and train a few strong new stems.
