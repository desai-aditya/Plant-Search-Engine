Still unknown to most Southerners, the plum yews give hope to gardeners in the Lower and Coastal South who love the look of  (Taxus) but whose climates are too hot to grow it. These slow-growing evergreens from Asia have long, bright green needles and, on female plants, produce small green or brown fruits that resemble plums. They accept almost any well-drained soil; do best in partial to full shade but will tolerate sun. And whereas deer will gnaw most Taxus species to the ground, they turn up their noses at plum yews.
