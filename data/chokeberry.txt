Native to southern Canada and the eastern U.S., these are tough, undemanding shrubs useful as fillers or background plantings. They tolerate a wide variety of soils. All tend to spread by suckering but are somewhat leggy (good for planting beneath). Small white or pinkish flowers appear in late spring and are followed by showy fruit that lasts well into winter. Fall foliage is brightly colored.
