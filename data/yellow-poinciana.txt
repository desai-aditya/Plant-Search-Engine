Native to Australia and Malaysia, this fast-growing, highly ornamental tree is popular in south Florida. It reaches 50 feet tall and 2530 feet wide and features large, feathery leaves that resemble those of mimosa (Albizia julibrissin). Handsome smooth, gray bark. Erect flower spikes, 1112 feet long, carry fragrant, 112 inches yellow flowers over a long period in summer. Flowers give rise to flattened, winged, wine-red seedpods up to 4 inches long.Yellow poinciana is easy to grow; tolerates most well-drained soils and has no serious pests. It naturally forms a multitrunked, wide-spreading tree but is easily pruned to a single trunk. Good choice for a lawn, shade, or street tree. Roots can lift pavement, so allow 810 feet between tree and sidewalk or other paved area.
