Native to central Asia. Wiry, 12- to 16 inches stems rise from a clump of narrow, gray-green leaves, bearing loose clusters of 1 inches flowers in late spring. Each blue-violet blos- som has six narrow petals marked with a darker central line. Foliage dies down in summer, not to reappear until the following spring. Bulbs tolerate moderate summer moisture but don't need any.Plant in fall, setting bulbs 3 inches deep, 3 inches apart. Bulbs can remain in place for many yearsthough good drainage is essential to prevent rotting. Dig and divide clumps in fall when they become crowded.
