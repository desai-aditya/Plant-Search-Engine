Native from Kansas to Texas and Georgia; closely related to coneflowers (Echinacea, Rudbeckia) and Mexican hat (Ratibida columnifera). Slender stems reach 23 feet tall; oval, pointed, medium green leaves clasp the stems. Blooms in late spring, bearing flowers to 2 inches across with a dark brown or purple central cone and yellow rays that are sometimes flushed orange or brown at the base. Tolerates a wide range of soils, including wet, heavy, poorly drained ones. Use in wildflower meadows or naturalized areas; also good in mixed herbaceous borders. Attracts butterflies. No significant pests. Sow seed directly into the garden after last spring frost. Will self-seed.
