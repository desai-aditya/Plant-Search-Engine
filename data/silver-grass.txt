Among the showiest and liveliest-looking of ornamental grasses, these are clump-forming plants that range from very large kinds to dwarf types good for small gardens and containers. Attractive flower panicles appear atop tall stalks; they open as tassels and gradually expand into silvery to pinkish or bronze plumes that usually last well into winter. Leaves are broad or narrow, always graceful; they may be solid colored, striped lengthwise, or banded crosswise. In fall and winter, foliage of most species turns shades of yellow, orange, or reddish brown; it looks especially showy against snow or a background of dark evergreens. Stunning accent plants in large pots. Best planted in spring. Deer resistant.Plant begins blooming in spring in Coastal South; cutting stems nearly to ground when plumes begin to fade will produce a second bloom flushsometimes even a third one. Cutting back stems also keeps clump looking fresh. Where winters are cold, bloom time comes in mid- to late summer. Plumes age to tan and drop their seeds before winter, leaving bare stems. Makes a good large-scale ground cover if given regular moisture and yearly mowing.Cut back old foliage nearly to the ground before new leaves sprout in early spring; in climates with a long growing season, you can cut back again in mid- summer to keep compact and to freshen foliage. Some selections collapse at bloom time unless given support of four or five narrow stakes inserted inconspicuously at edge of clump, concealed by foliage; wind twine or wire around stakes and clump at two levels. Divide in early spring every 2 or 3 years to limit clump size and prevent decline in vigor. Variegated types and thin-leafed species don't do well in central and southern Florida.
