Usually associated with the Scottish highlands, heaths are delightful little shrubs. They combine fine-textured, short, needlelike leaves with masses of showy flowers in winter, spring, or summer; blooms may be shaped like tiny bells, urns, or tubes. Flower color ranges from white to pink through lavender to red; foliage colors include bright green, gray-green, yellow, orange, and bronze. Heaths are most effective when massed on berms and banks or used as a ground cover. Deer don't browse them.Heaths do better in the South than their cousins the heathers (Calluna), but that doesn't mean they're easy to grow. They require a sunny spot but need light afternoon shade during the hottest days of summer. The soil should be loose, acidic, and well drained, with plenty of organic matter. Sandy soil amended with sphagnum peat moss or compost is ideal; heavy clay usually proves fatal. Do not fertilize. Shear or cut off faded flower spikes in spring, but don't cut back into leafless woodif you do, new foliage may not sprout. The most dependable heath for the South is Erica darleyensis.
