Vigorous and showy, this woody Southern native can climb to 60 feet by tendrils and holdfast disks, attaching itself to almost any surface. Each shiny, dark green leaf consists of two 2- to 6 inches leaflets and a branching tendril. Leaves turn purplish            in cold weather, and some drop in freezing weather. Clustered, 2 inches., trumpet-shaped reddish brown to orange or scarlet flowers appear in midspring, with intermittent summer bloom. 'Atrosanguinea' has reddish purple blooms and longer,            narrower leaves than the species. 'Dragon Lady' has rich red blooms. 'Jekyll' has slightly smaller flowers that are yellow on the inside, orange on the outside. Stunning 'Tangerine Beauty' blooms profusely,            producing tangerine red blossoms with yellow throats.Very easy to grow, with few problems. Prefers acid, moist soil, but tolerates drought. Prune after flowering. Vine is especially pretty when cloaking a sturdy trellis over an entry gate. Or train it over an arbor.
