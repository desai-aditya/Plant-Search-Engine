These mid-height perennials are covered with pincushion flowers in summer. Basal leaves are barely lobed, but those on upper stems are deeply divided. Undemanding meadow plants, they are at home in cottage gardens, wild gardens, perennial borders, and roadside plantings. Cut flowers are good for fresh or dried arrangements. Resist deer.
