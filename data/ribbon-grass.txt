This tough, tenacious grass from North America and Eurasia is an old Southern favorite; it forms a 2- to 3 feet-high clump that spreads aggressivelyand indefinitelyby underground runners. Deep green leaves with longitudinal white stripes turn buff colored in autumn; airy white flower clusters age to pale brown. To keep this plant in bounds, grow it in large containers or use same control methods as for running kinds of bamboo (see Bamboo). Less invasive selections are 'Woods Dwarf' ('Dwarf's Garters'), which grows about half as tall as the species and has brighter white stripes; and 'Feesey' ('Strawberries and Cream'), to 12 feet tall, with white stripes that usually take on pink tints during cool weather.
