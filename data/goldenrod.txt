These North American natives are not as widely grown as they deserve, largely due to the mistaken belief that their pollen causes hay fever (in fact, other plants are responsible). Although a few of the hundred-plus species are weeds in many regions, many are choice garden plants. All have leafy stems rising from tough, woody, spreading rootstocks; all bear small yellow flowers in large, branching, typically one-sided clusters from mid- or late summer into fall. Good cut flowers. These are tough plants that thrive in not-too-rich soil. Use in borders with black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta) or Michaelmas daisy (Aster novi-belgii), or naturalize in meadows. Butterflies are attracted to goldenrod flowers, and birds enjoy the seeds.
