Large, spreading trees suitable for big properties. All produce oval or round, edible nuts in fleshy husks. Nuts of native species have a wild flavor; those of English walnut (Juglans regia) are the ones sold commercially. These trees have shallow, competitive root systems (a chemical released by the roots, fallen leaves, and nuts of black walnut trees can kill other plants), and their pollen can cause an allergic reaction. They tend to be out of leaf for a long time and can be messy when in leaf. Worth growing if you like the nuts or need large trees that thrive in adverse conditions.
