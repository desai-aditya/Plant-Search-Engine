Grow these large, airy shrubs for their white spring flowers and colorful summer berries. In big gardens, they make effective summer screens or windbreaks. To keep shrubby types dense, prune hard in dormant season, removing older stems and heading back last year's growth to a few inches. Overgrown plants can be cut to the ground. Types that grow into trees need early training to single or multiple trunks.The various elder species have bright to dark green leaves and near-black, blue, or red berries. Fruit of red-berried species and of Sambucus nigra caerulea can cause gastric upset if consumed in large quantities. (Red-fruited forms of black- and blue-berried species are not poisonous.)Several selections grow 68 feet tall and wide: 'Aureomarginata', green leaves edged in yellow; 'Laciniata', very finely cut green foliage; and white-fruited 'Marginata' ('Albovariegata', 'Variegata'), green leaves bordered in creamy white.Two smaller selections (45 feet tall and wide) are 'Madonna', bearing green leaves that are variegated in light green to chartreuse when young and in cream, yellow, or gray-green when mature; and 'Pulverulenta', with leaves that unfold white, then mature to green splashed and striped with white.
