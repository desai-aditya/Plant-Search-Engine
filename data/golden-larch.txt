Where space permits, golden larch becomes a specimen tree of great character. This Chinese native grows very slowly into a 4070 feet pyramid, nearly as broad as tall at the base. Foliage has a feathery look; needles are clustered in tufts except near pendulous branch ends, where they are single. Needles open light green, mature to bluish green, then turn a magnificent golden yellow very briefly in autumn before dropping. Cones and bare branches present an interesting pattern in winter. Needs shelter from cold winds. Best in deep, rich, well-drained, acid soil; performance is better in colder part of range.
