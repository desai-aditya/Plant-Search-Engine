Saltbush has so much going for it, it's a mystery why it remains largely unknown to Southern gardeners. This upright, multistemmed shrub grows 610 feet tall and wide and features handsome leaves in soft gray-green. What really sets it apart are the fluffy white seed heads that cover it in fallthough it's actually gone to seed, the plant looks as if it's in bloom. It's tough and resilient, needing only a sunny spot. It tolerates poor, clay, and rocky soil, as well as drought, moisture, wind, salt spray, and browsing deer. Excellent in naturalized areas or at the beach. Female plants are showier than male plants. Cut seed heads look great in arrangements. Self-sows prolifically. 'Orient Point' forms a mound 56 feet tall and wide and features seed heads that are red at the base, creating a bicolor effect. 'White Caps' grows upright to 10 feet and has especially showy seed heads.
