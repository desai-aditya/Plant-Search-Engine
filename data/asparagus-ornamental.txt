There are about 150 kinds of asparagus besides the edible oneall are members of the lily family. Those described here are native to South Africa. Best known is asparagus fern (Asparagus setaceus), which is not a true fern. Although valued mostly for handsome foliage of unusual textural quality, some of the ornamental species have small but fragrant flowers and colorful berries. Green foliage sprays are made up of what look like leaves. Needlelike or broader, these are actually short branches called cladodes. The true leaves are inconspicuous dry scales.Most ornamental asparagus look greenest in partial shade. Leaves yellow in dense shade. Plant in well-drained soil amended with peat moss or ground bark. Thanks to their fleshy roots, plants can go for some time without water, but they grow better when watered regularly. Feed in spring with complete fertilizer. Trim out old shoots to make room for new growth. Ornamental asparagus will survive light frosts but may be killed to ground by severe cold. After frost, plants often come back from roots.
