Native to the eastern U.S. This bold-textured, easy-to-grow fern got its name because it turns brown with the very first kiss of frost in fall. It produces two types of fronds. The sterile ones are large (24 feet long) and lance- shaped to triangular; the fertile ones are smaller, holding erect clusters of beadlike leaflets that turn brown at maturity. Fronds grow from creeping rhizomes that spread quickly in moist, fertile soil. Plant is a good choicefor rain garden, pond, and streamside plantings and naturalized areas. Be sure plants grown in sun are kept well watered. Dies to the ground in winter.
