If you can't grow pothos, you may as well give up gardening. This philodendron relative from the Solomon Islands is one of the toughest houseplants around, tolerating low light, infrequent watering, and near-total neglect. Oval, leathery, 2- to 4 inches-long leaves are dark green splashed or marbled with cream or yellow. Indoors, pothos is commonly used as a trailing vine for decorating tabletops, window boxes, and plant stands; it never stops growing and eventually follows you from one room to another. Outdoors in the Tropical South, it becomes a big, tropical-looking vine with deeply cut, really large (2- to 212 feet-long) leaves. It is capable of climbing the tallest trees. Popular 'Marble Queen' displays white foliage flecked with cream and green. 'Neon' is lime-green.Pothos tolerates shade but shows better color when grown in sun. Allow the soil to become fairly dry between waterings. Feed every other week in spring and summer and monthly in fall and winter with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer. Mist occasionally for best appearance. Do not expose plants to temperatures below 50F. Easily propagated by cuttings (best taken in summer). Mealybugs can be a problem; wipe them off with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol.
