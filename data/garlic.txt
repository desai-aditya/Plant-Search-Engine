Classified botanically as Allium sativum; not known in the wild. For ornamental relatives, see Allium. Seed stores and some mail-order seed houses sell disease-free mother bulbs (sets) for plantingand some gardeners have had good luck planting buIbs from grocery stores. In mild-winter areas, plant in fall for early summer harvest; where winters are cold, plant in early spring. Break up bulbs into cloves and select largest ones. Plant in rich, well-drained soil, setting cloves pointed end up, 1 inches deep, 36 inches apart, in rows 15 inches apart. Harvest when leafy tops fall over; lift out with garden fork rather than pulling. Air-dry bulbs, cut off most of tops and roots, and store in cool, well-ventilated place out of sunlight. Giant or elephant garlic (A. scorodoprasum) has unusually large (fist-size) bulbs and mild flavor. Grow as for regular garlic, but space 812 inches apart. Harvest when first leaves turn yellow.
