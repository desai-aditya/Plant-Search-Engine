These conifers form slender pyramids with horizontal branches and drooping branchlets. Needles are 1 inches long, in soft, fluffy tufts. Woody, roundish, - to 1 inches-long cones are scattered all along branchlets. Notable for color in spring and  fall and for winter silhouette.  In spring, trees show off tufts of  pale green new needles, bright purple-red new cones. In fall, needles turn brilliant yellow and orange before dropping. Winter interest is enhanced by the many cones, which turn brown with  age and hang on to create a polka-dot pattern against the  sky. Best in regions with cold winters. Not particular about  soil. Plant with dark evergreen conifers as background or near water for reflection. Larches attract birds.
