Slowly spreading rhizomes send up arching stems clothed in broadly oval leaves arranged in nearly horizontal planes. Where leaves join stems, pairs or clusters of small, bell-shaped greenish white flowers appear in spring, hanging beneath the stems on threadlike stalks. Small blue-black berries may follow flowers. Leaves and stems turn bright yellow in fall before plant dies to the ground. Attractive for form and flowers in woodland garden; good with astilbe, ferns, hellebore, hosta, wild ginger (Asarum). Grow in loose, woodsy soil. Can remain in place for years; to increase your plantings, dig rhizomes from clump edges in early spring, and replant. Good in containers.
