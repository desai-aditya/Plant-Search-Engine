Growing gingers is a snap. Plants thrive in Southern heat and humidity, spreading slowly but widely by rhizomes. Most folks' knowledge of this genus begins and ends with one species, Zingiber officinale, the source of culinary gingerbut there are also dozens of highly ornamental species, of which a small sampling is presented here.Plant in rich, moist, well-drained soil, placing rhizomes just below the soil surface. Propagate by division in early spring. Plants go dormant in winter, and rhizomes may rot in cold, wet soil. You can grow gingers in pots and move them to shelter in winter; feed once a month during active growth with a general-purpose liquid fertilizer.
