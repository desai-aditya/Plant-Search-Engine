Native to South Africa, this tender shrub combines handsome foliage with showy, daisylike blooms. It's easy to grow and quite long blooming, making it  a natural choice for low- maintenance gardens; it is also good for the back of the border, in containers, or as a low screen. Grows 36 feet high and wide, with gray-green, deeply cut leaves about 2 inches long. Bright yellow, 1- to 2 inches-wide daisies on 6 inches stems appear nearly continuously in warm weather, though blooming may slow during the dog days of summer. 'Viridis' is identical to the species but has deep green leaves. 'Munchkin' tops out at 3 feet tall and 4 feet wide.Bush daisy thrives in almost any well-drained soil and tolerates buffeting ocean winds.  It's winter hardy in the Coastal and Tropical South; in colder areas, grow it as an annual. Pick off old blooms to maintain neat appearance and extend the blooming season; shear lightly  to control size.
