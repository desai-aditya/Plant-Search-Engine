Northwest natives. Starlike, slender-petaled blossoms are carried on spikes in late spring, early summer; grasslike basal leaves dry quickly after bloom. Plant in consistently moist, fairly heavy soil, where bulbs can remain undisturbed for many years. Set bulbs 4 inches deep, 6 inches apart. To avoid premature sprouting, plant after weather cools in fall. Resistant to deer and rodents.
