From southern Russia, Caucasus. Dense clumps of dark green, narrowly oval leaves grow from a woody rootstock. In summer, leafless flower stalks rise to 112 feet., forking repeatedly to form a broad, domed cluster to 112 feet wide. Tiny flowers are light purplish to white and make good fillers in fresh bouquets. Entire inflorescence can also be dried for winter arrangements. Plant withstands both cold and heat; also highly salt tolerant. Best where summers are hot and dry. To avoid fungal problems, provide well-drained soil and good air circulation.
