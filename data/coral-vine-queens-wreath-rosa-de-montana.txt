This classic vine of the Deep South is actually native to Mexico and thrives in sweltering summer weather. A rampant grower that climbs by tendrils, it can easily cover 20 feet in a year. Its hand- some, bright green, heart- or arrow- shaped leaves reach 35 inches long. From summer to fall, bears a profusion of coral-pink flowers in airy, arching sprays to 6 inches or longer; a vine in full bloom is a magnificent sight. Selections include white 'Album', deep reddish pink 'Baja Red', and near- red 'Rubrum'. Seedlings of these selections vary in flower color.Coral vine grows from a large tuber and is evergreen in the Tropical South. In regions where winter temperatures drop below 25F, the plant often dies back to the ground, then resprouts in spring. Mulching in autumn helps to protect the roots during winter in the Lower South. In the Upper and Middle South, treat coral vine as an annual, saving the seeds for next year's plants.Coral vine is a common sight in Florida, Louisiana, the Gulf Coast, and parts of Central and Southeast Texas. Use it to shade a patio, porch, or terrace, or let its blossoms and foliage adorn fences, walls, railings, and balconies.
