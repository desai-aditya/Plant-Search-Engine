Native to South Africa, these woody perennials are closely related to Dimorphotheca and often sold as such. Mounded or trailing in habit, they bear a profusion of daisylike flowers during mild weather; flowering decreases or halts altogether during long, hot stretches.  Tend to be short lived in the South. Used as winter annuals  in Florida. Narrow, oval leaves  are 24 inches long. Flowers of most open only in sunlight.Tolerate heat and drought but look better with moderate water. Give loose, fertile soil; good drainage is a must. Pinch out growing tips of young plants to induce bushiness; cut back old, sprawling branches to young side growth in late summer to midautumn. Mass along driveways and paths; or use in borders, rock gardens, containers. Types that spread by rooting stems are good on slopes. Not usually browsed by deer.
