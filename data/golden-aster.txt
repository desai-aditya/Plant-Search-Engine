These tough, showy, little-known perennials native to the northeastern U.S. deserve wider use. They tolerate heat, drought, humidity, and poor soil and have no serious pests. Daisylike yellow blooms decorate the plants for many weeks in late summer and fall. Give them good drainage and plenty of sun. Dig and divide crowded clumps in early spring. Resist deer.
