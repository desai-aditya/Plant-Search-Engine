Wispy, free-flowering plant from Europe, good for summer borders and fresh or dried arrangements. Gray-green, grassy leaves form a clump to 1 feet high and wide. Lavender-blue, 2 inches flower heads, reminiscent of cornflowers (Centaurea cyanus) and surrounded by strawlike, shining bracts, appear atop leafless stems to 2 feet high. Remove faded flowers to prolong bloom. Selections include white 'Alba', cornflower blue 'Blue Giant', and deep blue-violet 'Major'. Plants will flower first year from seed sown in early spring. Rather short lived, but volunteer seedlings usually provide replacements.
