Native to the Himalayas, China. Grown for handsome, waxy, dark green leaves and tiny, powerfully fragrant, white blossoms that come in late winter or early spring, hidden in the foliage. Small, berrylike fruit follows the flowers. Useful in shaded areasunder overhangs, in entryways, beneath low-branching evergreen trees. Plants maintain slow, orderly growth and polished appearance in deepest shade. Grow best in organically enriched soil; very tough and drought-tolerant once established. Scale insects are the only pests. Deer leave it alone.
