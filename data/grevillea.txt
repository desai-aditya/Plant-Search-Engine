Native to Australia. Many species and hybrids. Plants vary in size and appearance but generally have fine-textured foliage and long, slender, curved flowers, usually in dense clusters. Provide good drainage. Like other members of the protea family, grevilleas are sensitive to high levels of phosphorus in the soil, so feed lightly and avoid fertilizers with high phosphorus content. Intolerant of salt. Seldom browsed by deer.
