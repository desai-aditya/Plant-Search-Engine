Native to the Southeast, the Midwest, and Texas, Indian paintbrushes are among the most difficult wildflowers to get established in garden conditions, but once growing, they are quite tough. Small, inconspicuous flowers appear in spring among showy fan-shaped bracts that range in color from pink and purple to yellow, orange, and flame red. Sow seeds thickly among plants such as grasses or perennials, because during germination these wildflowers may draw nourishment from the roots of other plants.
