These mint-family members have the typical square stems and leaves in opposite pairs; foliage ranges from rough textured  to furry. Most of the species described here have short-stalked or stalkless leaves. Spikelike clusters of small, usually two- lipped flowers bloom in late spring and summer; blossoms are attractive to bees. All are fairly unfussy about soil type, needing only good drainage. Green-leafed species need some shade where summers are hot. Clumps often die out in center; divide and replant outer sections. Deer usually leave these plants alone.Use all forms for contrast  with dark green foliage and with leaves of different shapes, such as those of strawberry or some sedums. Good edging for paths, flower beds. Excellent ground cover in high, open shade, such as under tall oaks; space plants 2 feet apart.
