Prized for their bright, coppery red new foliage, these large, handsome plants are mainly used for screening and hedges, although they can be pruned into single-trunk small trees. But consider their inherent problems before adding them to your garden. They produce flattened clusters of malodorous, white flowers in spring; the flowers are followed in fall by red or black berries that birds eat and distribute seedlings everywhere. In most of the South, they're subject to serious, disfiguring diseases. Evergreen species are injured or killed by prolonged periods of temperatures below 10F.
