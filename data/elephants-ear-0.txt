Tropical plants related to Alocasia and Colocasia. Stemless plants grow to 6 feet tall and wide and produce big, arrow-shaped leaves on long stalks. Bloom intermittently throughout the year. Flowers are more curious than attractive, resembling those of calla (Zantedeschia), with a central spike surrounded by a usually greenish or yellowish bract. These plants need moist, rich, well-drained soil for best performance. Protect from hard frosts. Indoors, grow in large pots and apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every two to three weeks during active growth; reduce watering and feeding in winter.
