Botanically known as Armoracia rusticana. Native to southeastern Europe. Large (to about 3 feet), coarse, weedy-looking plant grown for its large white roots. Does best in rich, moist, acid, well-drained soils. Grow it in some sunny, out- of-the-way corner. In late winter or early spring, set in a hole 68 inches deep so that top of root is even with soil surface. Fill hole with soil and then mound 35 inches of soil over the top. One plant should provide enough horseradish for a family of four. For multiple plants, space 2123 feet apart. Keep soil slightly moist during summer months; drought results in bitter roots.Through fall, winter, and spring, harvest pieces of horseradish roots from the outside of the root clump as you need them that way you'll have your horseradish fresh and tangy. Scrub and peel the roots, cutting away any dark parts; then grate them. Good ventilation is a must. Mix with vinegar, sweet cream, or sour creamor simply sprinkle directly onto food. Roots can also be stored in plastic bags in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.
