These brightly flowered shrubs grow fast in warm, sheltered spots, with an arching, lax growth habit that benefits from consistent pinching and nipping back. May be cut back severely after flowering or fruiting. Clusters of tubular, inch-long flowers are attractive to hummingbirds; the showy fruit that follows can also attract birds. Add organic soil amendments before planting. Feed generously.
