This European native grows 23 feet tall and 10 inches wide, with several erect stems rising from the rootstock. Smooth, bright green leaves, 410 inches long, are attractively cut and lobed. Profuse yellow to orange-yellow flowers to 1 inches wide bloom in summer. Self-sows freely and naturalizes (sometimes too well; may become invasive). Double-flowered 'Flore Pleno' also seeds itself freely. Both forms are best in wild gardens. Juice from the stems is said to get rid of warts.
