An old-fashioned Mediterranean favorite to 11 feet high, 10 inches wide. All leaves, even those that form under the collar beneath each flower, are finely cut into threadlike divisions. Blue, white, or rose-colored blooms, 11 inches across, are borne singly at branch ends in spring. Curious papery-textured, horned seed capsules lend an airy effect to bouquets and mixed borders and look decorative in dried arrangements. 'Miss Jekyll', to 1 feet tall, has semidouble cornflower-blue blossoms. Persian Jewels, to 15 inches tall, is a superior strain in a mix of colors.Love-in-a-mist comes into bloom quickly in spring, dries up in summer heat. Start from seed in spring, as soon as ground is workable and frost danger is past; can be sown in autumn in mild-winter areas. Sow seeds where plants are to grow, since the long taproot makes transplanting unsatisfactory. Self-sows freely.
