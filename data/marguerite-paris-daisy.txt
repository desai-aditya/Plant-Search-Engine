Formerly known as Chrysanthemum frutescens, this is a short-lived, shrubby perennial where it is hardy; grown as summer annual elsewhere. Canary Island native has bright green, coarsely divided leaves and abundant daisies 112212 inches across in white, yellow, or pink. Plant reaches about 212 feet tall and wide. 'Pink Lady' and 'White Lady' produce buttonlike flower heads; 'Silver Leaf' has gray-green leaves and masses of very small white flowers. 'Snow White', double anemone type, has pure white flowers, more restrained growth habit. Dwarf selections also available.All types are splendid in containers and for quick effects in borders, mass displays in new gardens. For continued bloom, prune lightly at frequent intervals. In Coastal and Tropical South, do not prune severely, since plants seldom produce new growth from hardened wood; replace every 2 to 3 years.
