Native to tropical America, mostly Mexico. Showy summer- and fall-blooming plants, open and branching in habit, with bright green, divided leaves and daisylike flowers in many colors and forms (single, double, crested, frilled). Heights vary from 212 to 8 feet Use for mass color in borders or background, or as a filler among shrubs. Useful in arrangements if flowers are cut just after they open and placed immediately in deep, cool water. Sow seed in open ground where plants are to grow; or set out transplants from spring to summer. Plant in not-too-rich  soil. Plants self-sow freely and attract birds and butterflies.
