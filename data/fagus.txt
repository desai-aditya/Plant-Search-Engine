Beeches are grand trees, capable of growing 90 feet tall and 60 feet wide after many years. Their majestic outlines range from rounded to broadly pyramidal, with wide, sweeping lower branches that sometimes touch the ground; some selections weep attractively. Handsome, smooth gray bark contrasts nicely with glossy, dark green foliage.  In autumn, leaves turn yellow with green veins, then golden or reddish brown, then fade to tan; these buff-colored leaves hang on through most of winter and are quite beautiful in the winter landscape. A layered, lacy branching pattern and long, pointed leaf buds add to the attractive winter silhouette. Small nuts enclosed in spiny husks attract squirrels, blue jays, and other wildlife.Beeches aren't the easiest trees to work into a home landscape. They are too large for smaller lots; their thick network of surface roots and the heavy shade they cast make it almost impossible to grow a lawn or other plants  beneath them. However, they work well at the edge of a woodland or in naturalized areas. Fancy-leafed or weeping forms  of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) are good as specimens or  accents.Beeches like deep, fertile, loose, soil that is neutral to slightly acid. Never park cars or heavy vehicles under a large beech, as this crushes sensitive feeder roots and results in the tree's slow demise. Woolly beech aphids on the undersides of the leaves sometimes cause the foliage to pucker, turn blotchy, and drop, but they are seldom a serious problem.
