Blackberries grow in areas of the South where summers are not too dry and winters not too harsh. They thrive along the eastern coast, as well as in the cool-night areas of the Appalachians, Ozarks, and Blue Ridge Mountains.Upright (erect) types tend to be hardy and stiff caned; they usually grow 46 feet high. Trailing kinds, known as dewberries or boysenberries, are more lax plants that need support. Crosses between upright and trailing types are termed semierect. Canes of most blackberries are covered with sharp thorns.All types bear fruit in summer. The fruit clusters of trailing plants ripen earlier and are smaller and more open than those of erect or semierect types. The fruit makes excellent pies, fine jams and jellies, tangy syrups, and even good wines.The following are some of the top blackberry selections for the South. Plants are deciduous, except as noted.
