It can't be  surpassed, however, for naturalizing on sunny hillsides, along drives, or in dry fields, vacant lots, parking strips, or country gardens.There are dozens of garden forms of California poppy, and new ones appear on the market regularly. The flowers come in shades of yellow, pink, rose, flame orange, red, reddish purple, and creamy white. Some have petals streaked or bordered in contrasting colors; they may be single, semidouble, double, fluted, or frilled. All tend to revert to the basic orange or yellow form when they reseed.Sow seeds in fall where plants are to grow; seedlings don't transplant well. Broadcast on cultivated, well-drained soil; if  rain is absent, water to keep ground moist until seeds germinate. For large-scale sowing, use 3 to 4 pounds of seeds per acre. Birds are attracted to the seeds, so keep an eye out. Drought  tolerant, but looks better and blooms longer with more water.
