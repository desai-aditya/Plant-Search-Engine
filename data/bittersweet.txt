Grown principally for clusters of handsome autumn fruityellow-to-orange capsules that split open to display brilliant red seeds inside. Birds seem uninterested in the fruit, so the display extends into winter. Branches bearing fruit are much prized for indoor arrangements. To produce fruit, you will need to plant a male and a female plant close to each other.Bittersweets are vigorous, twining vines with ropelike branches; they need support. They will become a tangled mass of intertwining branches unless pruned constantly. Cut out fruiting branches in winter; pinch out tips of vigorous branches in summer.
