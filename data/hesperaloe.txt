Clumps of narrow, evergreen leaves with threadlike fringe along edges give rise to tall, branching inflorescences set with many tubular flowers that attact hummingbirds. Foliage clumps resemble yucca or coarse grass. Plants require little maintenance aside from removal of spent flower clusters. Estab- lished plants can get by with little summer water and aren't fussy about soil as long as it is well drained.
