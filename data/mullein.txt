Large group of rosette-forming, summer-blooming plants that send up spikes closely set with nearly flat, five-petaled, circular flowers about an inch across. Both foliage and stems are often covered in woolly hairs. Taller mulleins make striking vertical accents. All mulleins self-sow freelyand some are downright weedy, such as the attractive roadside wildflower Verbascum thapsus. Perennial species are short lived in hot, humid climates.Cotswold hybrids. Perennials. These resemble Verbascum phoeniceum but come in white, cream, yellow, pink, and purple. Named selections are sometimes offered, including creamy yellow 'Gainsborough' and bright pink 'Pink Domino'.Grow in well-drained soil that is not too rich; fertile, acidic soil makes plants grow so tall that they may need staking. Cut off spent flowers to encourage a second round of blooming. Leave spikes of biennial species in place if you want plants to spread by reseeding.
