From Australia. Upright plant to  2 feet tall, 10 inches wide, with finely divided leaves and numerous small lavender-blue flowers in  2- to 3 inches-wide, flat-topped clusters. Blossoms have a lacy look, make good cut flowers. Grow in light, rich, well-drained soil. Sow seeds in place, as taproot makes transplanting difficult. Does not perform well in heat. Sow in fall for winter and spring bloom.
