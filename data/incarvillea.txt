Native to the Himalayas and China, these plants have showy trumpet- shaped flowers similar to those of their trumpet vine relatives (Bignonia, Campsis, and the like). Flowers are large for the size of the plant. Many species are coming into cultivation, but only the following two have reached North American gardens in any num- bers. Leaves are 28 inches long, divided featherwise into leaflets. Plants are deep rooted and need reasonably deep soil and excellent drainage. In Upper South, mulch plants after the soil has frozen (to prevent ground from heaving). Protect from slugs and snails.
