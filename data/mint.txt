These Mediterranean natives spread rapidly by underground stems and can be quite invasive; to keep them in bounds, grow them in pots or boxes. Tough and unfussy, they grow almost anywhere but perform best in light, moist, medium-rich soil. Not favored by deer. Plants disappear in winter in colder part of range. Replant about every 3 years; propagate by division or runners.
