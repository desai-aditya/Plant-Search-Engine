Handsome plants ranging from less than an inch tall to 2 feet in height. Masses of small (14- to 12 inches-wide) flowers in white, rose, pink, or pale to deep blue make an effective display. Use in borders and rock gardens. Flowers attract butterflies. Prostrate kinds are good between stepping stones, as bulb covers. Named selections are not easily assigned to a species; authorities differ.
