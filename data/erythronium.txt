Spring-blooming plants with dainty, nodding, lily-shaped owers to 11 inches across, on stems usually 1 feet high or less. All have two (rarely three) broad, tongue-shaped, basal leaves that are mottled in many species. All need some subfreezing temperatures. Plant in groups under trees, in rock gardens, beside pools or streams. Set out bulbs in fall, 23 inches deep, 45 inches apart, in rich, porous soil; plant bulbs as soon as you receive them, and don't let them dry out. May take a few years after planting to begin blooming. Difficult to transplant once established, because bulbs work their way deep into the soil. Not eaten by rodents or deer.
