Attractive, upright, arching evergreen shrub native to South Carolina and south to Florida. Grows to 812 feet tall and wide. Oval leaves to 4 inches long are coppery red when new, maturing to a glossy rich green. Cream-colored flowers, borne in early summer, are fragrant but not showy.This plant has an open, multistemmed form that makes it an excellent addition to the woodland garden as a loose, informal screen; it likes shade and moist, acid soil. Good companion for azaleas, rhododendrons, mountain laurel (Kalmia), and ferns. Remove old branches at the base periodically to retain the handsome open habit. Avoid shearing. 'Leprechaun' grows only 35 feet tall and 23 feet wide, with new leaves that emerge red. Formerly known as Leucothoe populifolia.
