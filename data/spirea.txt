Unless your garden sits in a cave or the middle of the ocean, you probably have room for a spirea. They are a varied lot, offering a number of sizes, forms, and flowering seasonsbut they can be broken down into two basic groups according to bloom time. Spring bloomers feature clusters of white flowers cascading down from arching branches; summer bloomers are compact and shrubby, with pink, red, or white flowers clustered at the branch ends. Both types look more effective when massed in sweeps and borders than when used singly. White-flowered spireas look better against a dark background. The cut branches of spring-flowering types are great for forcing into bloom for indoor arrangements.All spireas are tough and easy to grow; with few exceptions, they are not fussy about soil. Deer don't favor them.Prune spring bloomers yearly in late spring after flowering, cutting one-third of the oldest branches to the ground. Prune summer bloomers in winter or earliest spring, before new growth begins; they generally need less pruning than spring bloomers. If you remove spent flower clusters in summer, plants will produce a second (but less lavish) bloom.
