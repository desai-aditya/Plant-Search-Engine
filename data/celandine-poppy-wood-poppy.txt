Native to eastern U.S. Forms a  1- to 2 feet-wide basal rosette of downy, gray-green, 8- to 12 inches-long leaves that are deeply lobed into five or seven scallop-edged segments. Golden yellow, quite showy flowers are 12 inches wide; they appear singly or in loose, few-flowered clusters on branched stems 12 feet tall. Resembles greater celandine (Chelidonium majus) but is shorter and blooms in spring rather than summer. Easy to grow in acid or alkaline soil; reseeds and forms colonies if soil is rich and moist. Stems leak yellow sap when cut. Excellent in woodland gardens as companion to blue phlox, foamflower (Tiarella), Virginia bluebells (Mertensia pulmonarioides), and mayapple (Podophyllum).
