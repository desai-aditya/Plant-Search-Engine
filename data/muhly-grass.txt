Showy and easy to grow, these native U.S. grasses combine handsome, slender leaves with eye-catching flower plumes that typically appear in late summer and fall. Foliage is semievergreen to evergreen in mild-winter areas, deciduous elsewhere. Plants tolerate heat and drought, but they look better and grow larger if given supplemental water. Good drainage is a must. Most are well adapted to Texas and the Southwest but will also succeed in many other areas, including Florida. Cut plants nearly to the ground in late winter to encourage fresh new growth.
