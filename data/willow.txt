It's easy to see what people like about willows. They're fast growing and tolerate just about any type of soil. They're also the easiest of trees and shrubs to propagate: Just take cuttings at any time of year and stick them into moist soil. On the other hand, they are weak-wooded, short-lived trees, and their shallow, greedy roots make them hard to garden under and can invade water lines. Most are attacked by a host of pests (tent caterpillars, aphids, borers, spider mites) and diseases. Weeping willows do best near lakes and streams, although they can, with training, make satisfactory shade trees. Shrubby willows are grown chiefly for their showy catkins (this group is known as pussy willows) or colorful twigs, or to control erosion on riverbanks. Branches of pussy willows can be cut in bud in late winter and brought indoors to bloom. Willow species hybridize freely, resulting in much confusion of names in the nursery trade.
