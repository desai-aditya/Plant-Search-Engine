Native from Florida west to Texas and Mexico. Spindly, shrubby perennial with semiwoody stems. Blooms from early summer right through fall, bearing nodding, bright red, twisted-looking, 1- to 1 inches-long blossoms with long, prominent stamens similar to those of hibiscus. May reach 9 feet tall if soil is fertile and growing season long and warm, but usually grows 35 feet high and almost as wide. Dies back to the ground in winter. Long-stalked yellow-green leaves are coarse textured, heart shaped, 23 inches wide. Blooms attract hummingbirds. Small, rounded, applelike fruit follows the flowers, changing from white to red as it ripens. Tough, easy plant; tolerates alkaline and rocky soils and drought. Not usually browsed by deer. 'Big Momma' has coral-red blooms. 'Pam Puryear' has pink to coral-pink blooms.
