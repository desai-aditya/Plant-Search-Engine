Hollyhocks are cultivated for their big, colorful, funnel-shaped summer flowers. Need rich, well- drained soil.Sow seeds in ground in late summer for next season's bloom; seed annual strains in early spring for bloom that summer. After flowers fade, cut stalks just above the ground; continue to feed and water plants to encourage late-summer or early-fall rebloom. Destroy any rust-infected leaves as soon as disease appears. Look for yellow spots on the leaf surface and orange spots with spores underneath. The spores are carried on the wind and will weaken a plant and destroy new growth. Remove infected leaves from the plant as well as from the mulch below. Also watch for slugs, snails, Japanese beetles.
