Native to Australia and the South Pacific. Small feather palms with slender, ringed trunks and well-defined crown shafts (the smooth, usually green upper portion of the trunk, formed by overlapping bases of newer leaves). Frond segments are toothed at the tip. Small, fragrant flowers come in 1- to 2 feet-long clusters in summer; these are followed by bright red fruit. Grow in well-drained soil.
