Mediterranean natives related to sage (Salvia). Erect stems are set with widely spaced whorls of hooded, two-lipped flowers in yellow, purple, or lilac. Moisture-conserving, thick, typically furry or hairy leaves are lance shaped to oval, set opposite each other on stems. Not particular about soil but must have good drainage. Not usually damaged by browsing deer. Cut flowers are striking in arrangements.
