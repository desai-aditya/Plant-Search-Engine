Firs are handsome, erect, symmetrical trees with branches in regularly spaced whorls. Needles are short (mostly in the 1- to 2 inches range) and closely set along the branches; they're often banded white on the undersides. Attractive cones of most types grow 25 inches long.Many people confuse firs with spruces (Picea), but the two are easily distinguished. Fir needles are typically soft and pull cleanly from the stem; spruce needles have sharp points and pull off with a piece of stalk. Also, fir cones stand upright, while spruce cones hang down.With the exception of the Appalachian region, the South is generally a difficult environment for firs. They dislike summer heat and drought and heavy, poorly drained soils. Success depends on having rich, deep, well-drained soil, providing light shade in the afternoon, and replenishing mulch regularly to keep roots moist and cool. Firs are popular Christmas trees, both live and cut.
