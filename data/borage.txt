Delightful sky-blue, star-shaped flowers make this European native a kitchen-garden favorite. Plant forms a rounded clump 23 feet high, 1122 feet wide. Bristly, gray-green leaves to 46 inches long are edible, with a            cucumber-like flavor; use small, tender leaves in salads, pickle them, or cook them as you would greens. Many people grow the plant simply for its summer flowers: pretty, star-shaped, inch-wide blue blossoms that nod in leafy clusters from branched            stems. Cut flowers are attractive in arrangements and can also be used as a decorative garnish for iced drinks, green salads, and fruit compotes.Tolerates poor soil. Reseeds itself, but deep taproot makes transplanting difficult. In most of the South, the best way to start borage is to sow seeds in place in spring, after the danger of frost is past. In the Coastal and Tropical            South (USDA 9-11), sow in fall and grow as a fall-into-spring crop.
