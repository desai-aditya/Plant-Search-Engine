Elegant clumps of bright red, nearly vertical grass blades give this Japanese native grass both textural and visual punch. Erect stem forms a clump 12 feet tall, 1 feet wide. Striking in borders, especially where sun can shine through blades. Completely dormant in winter. Spreads slowly by underground runners. Rarely, if ever, flowers. Good for textural contrasts; mixes well with peren- nials that have yellow-green or blue-green foliage. Best in rich, well-drained soil. Waste no time in removing and destroying any reversions to the plain green- leafed form called cogon grass, which is extremely invasive and has spread throughout Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi.
