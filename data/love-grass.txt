Of about 250 species native to many temperate and tropical regions of the world, only a few are cultivated in gardens. These tough, carefree perennials form graceful clumps of fine-textured foliage. Airy floral plumes look like clouds floating above the leaves. Use love grasses as textural accents in containers or as bank or ground covers. They are drought tolerant and need excellent drainage; they thrive in sandy soils. Reseed readily and can be invasive. Not browsed  by deer.
