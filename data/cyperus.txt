These African natives are sedges grasslike plants distinguished from true grasses by three-angled, solid stems and very different flowering parts. Valued for striking form, silhouette, shadow pattern.Most species grow in rich, moist soil or with roots submerged in water. Keep plants groomed by removing dead or broken stems; divide and replant when the clump becomes too large, saving smaller, outside divisions and discarding the overgrown centers. Beyond their hardiness range, pot up divisions and keep them over the winter  as houseplants.
