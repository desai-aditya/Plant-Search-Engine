Odd-looking yet striking plants, these herbaceous barberry (Berberis) relatives grow from thick underground rhizomes that send up stalks crowned with large, shield-shaped, deeply lobed leaves. Shoots with a single leaf are barren; those with two leaves bear a single, 2 inches-wide flower (set between the leaves) in mid- to late spring. Blossoms are followed by juicy, 2 inches berries; these are edible when fully ripe (poisonous until that stage) but can have a powerful laxative effect. Make attractive, slowly spreading deciduous ground covers for shady areas with rich, moist, woodsy soil.
