Mostly ground cover-scale succulents that grow nicely in the spaces between rocks (thus, stonecrop), sedums are native to many parts of the world. Some are quite hardy to cold, others fairly tender; some are tiny and trailing, others much larger and upright. Fleshy leaves are evergreen (unless otherwise noted) but highly variable in size, shape, and color. Typically small, star-shaped flowers, sometimes brightly colored, are usually borne in fairly large clusters.Smaller sedums are useful in rock gardens, as ground or bank covers, in small areas where unusual texture is needed. Some are prized by collectors of succulents, who grow them in pots, dish gardens, or miniature gardens. Larger types are good in borders or containers. Most sedums are easy to propagate by stem cuttings; even detached leaves will root and form new plants. Soft and easily crushed, they will not take foot traffic, but they are otherwise tough, low-maintenance plants. Low-growing types often escape damage by browsing deer.Because of their long stems, all of these are best grown in a hanging basket or wall pot; or try them spilling from the top of a wall or in a rock garden. Provide rich, fast-draining soil (such as a half-and-half mixture of sand and potting soil). Protect from wind and give partial shade. Indoors, site in a south-facing window. Allow soil to become quite dry between thorough waterings, and feed in spring and summer with a general- purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer diluted to half-strength. Reduce watering and cease feeding in winter.
