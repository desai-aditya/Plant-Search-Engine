Native to Mexico and Guatemala. Tropical evergreen shrub, 46 feet tall and wide; grows outdoors only in the Coastal and Tropical South. Handsome, 2 inches., oblong, gray-green leaves; showy, 34 inches., bright yellow flowers in branched clusters, summer and fall. Fertilize from spring through fall. Prune out crowded branches to keep shape open. Brittle stems break easily, so don't plant where people will brush against the foliage. In cooler climates, grow in a pot that you can bring indoors for winter. Deer leave it alone. Formerly known as Thryallis glauca.
