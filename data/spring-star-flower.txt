Spring-blooming Argentine native with wildflower charm. Each bulb produces several slender stems, each bearing a single half-inch blossom with six overlapping petals. Usual color is light blue, but variants include white I. u. album and 'White Star', pink 'Charlotte Bishop', deep violet 'Froyle Mill', bright blue 'Rolf Fiedler', and medium blue 'Wisley Blue'. All have narrow, nearly flat, bluish green leaves that smell like onions when bruised. Use in borders or under deciduous shrubs; or naturalize in woodland areas or among low grasses. Not bothered by rodents or deer.In fall, set bulbs 2 inches deep and 2 inches apart. Prefers dry conditions during summer dormancy but will accept water if drainage is good. Divide infrequentlyplantings become more attractive over the years as bulbs multiply and reseed. They'll grow, multiply, and live happily in a low, wide container for several years.
