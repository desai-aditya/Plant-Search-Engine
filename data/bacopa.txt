From moist regions of South Africa. Wiry-stemmed creeper with green, roughly heart-shaped, toothed leaves less than 1 inches long. Blooms profusely from late spring to frost (though in much of the South it gives out once the dog days of summer arrive), producing small, five-petaled, golden-throated flowers. Fine in pots, hanging baskets, or as a small-scale ground cover. If used at the front of a border, plant in masses for greater impact. Perhaps best employed as a cool-season annual for spring or fall, or as a winter annual in Florida. Hardy to 28F.Original selection (sold as 'Snowflake') has 14 inches white flowers and grows 12 inches high, spreading 12 feet in a growing season; eventually covers 34 feet in mild climates. 'Giant Snowflake' is more vigorous, reaching 68 inches high, 34 feet wide in a season; its white flowers are 12 inches wide. 'Snowstorm' resembles 'Giant Snowflake' but blooms more profusely and has greater heat tolerance. 'Snowstorm Blue' and 'Snowstorm Pink' are also available. 'Olympic Gold' has leaves splotched with yellow but is otherwise identical to 'Snowstorm' (to which it sometimes reverts).Needs good drainage and air circulation, fertile soil, and regular feeding. Don't allow it to dry out; if it wilts, it probably won't recover. Pinch branch tips to keep plant shapely. If a thick layer of dead stems builds up under foliage, remove dead material and cut plant back to leave 5- to 6 inches-long branches with leafy growth.
