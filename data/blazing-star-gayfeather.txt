These showy plants native to the southern and central U.S. are butterfly magnets. Basal tufts of narrow, grassy leaves grow from thick, often tuberous rootstocks. In summer or early fall, the tufts lengthen into tall stems densely set with slender leaves and topped by a narrow plume of small, fluffy purple (sometimes white) flower heads. Flowers of most species are unusual in open- ing from top of spike downward. Choice cut flowers; deer resistant.These plants endure heat, cold, drought, and poor soil. Fertilizing will give you larger flower spikes, but it also results in taller plants that need staking. Best used in mixed perennial borders, although the rosy purple color calls for careful placing to avoid color clashes.
