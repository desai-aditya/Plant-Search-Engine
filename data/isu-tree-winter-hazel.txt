Hardy, little-known members of witch hazel family with lovely layered, arching branches and small clusters of late-winter to early-spring flowers in leaf axils followed by small, nutlet-like fruit. Maintains green color throughout winter. Adaptable but grows best in well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Responds well to hard pruning.
