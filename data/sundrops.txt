Found across the Southwest, these showy perennials share the same common name as some of their close relatives (and look-alikes) in the genus Oenothera. Bloom over a long season, from spring into late fall, bearing bright yellow, four- petaled flowers that open at sunset and remain open for most of the next day. Plants go dormant in winter and may be sheared just before spring growth begins. They spread by rhizomes and can take over a garden bed if unrestrained by a physical barrier, such as metal edging sunk 6 inches deep into the ground. Good for summer color in rock gardens or on rocky slopes; make nice filler plants in mixed borders. Like lots of heat and excellent drainage.
