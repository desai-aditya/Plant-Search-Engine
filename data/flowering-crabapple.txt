From North America, Europe, Asia. These beloved ornamental trees have much to offer, including spectacular springtime flowers, ornamental (and occasionally edible) fruit, and adaptability to a wide range of soil types and growing conditions. More than 600 kinds are cultivated, and a new selection seems to appear every few days.Trees range in height from 640 feet., but most reach about 25 feet high. Oval, pointed leaves may be solid deep green, burgundy tinged, or even purple; fall color is seldom rousing, but some types do turn yellow or even orange. Profuse single, semidouble, or double blossoms in white, pink, or red appear in spring, usually before the leaves unfurl; they sometimes have a sweet, musky fragrance. Small red, orange, or yellow apples (size varies from 34 to 2 inches wide) ripen from midsummer into autumn and can be quite showy. In some types, the fruit persists well into winter and supplies food for robins, mockingbirds, cardinals, cedar waxwings, blue jays, and many other birds.Among the most popular crabapple selections grown for fruit (used for jelly making and pickling) are 'Transcendent', with 2 inches., red-cheeked yellow apples that ripen in summer; 'Centennial', with 1 inches., scarlet-and-yellow fruit; and 'Dolgo', with 1 inches crimson fruit. The red-fruited 'Maypole' is a newer columnar dwarf crabapple. Other crabapples are prized for cider, including 'Virginia Crab' ('Hewe's Crab'), 'Geneva', and 'Giant Russian'.
