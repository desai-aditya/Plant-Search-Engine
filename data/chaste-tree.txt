Given the paucity of blue- flowered summer-blooming  trees and shrubs, it's a wonder more people aren't planting chaste trees. These drought-tolerant, pest-free plants combine striking blue or purple, tubular summer blossoms with hand- some leaves shaped like an  open hand. They grow in almost any well-drained soil, will take coastal conditions, and are not usually browsed by deer. The common name derives from the belief in medieval times that an extract from their fruit would curb the libido.Small, lightly fragrant, lilac to dark blue flowers in 6- to 12 inches spikes appear at branch ends and leaf joints in summer. Blooms come on new growth, so prune in late winter, removing twiggy growth and crowded branches. If you remove spent flowers before seeds form, plant will send out a second flush of blooms.Unnamed seedlings vary in showiness of flowers, so  buy a plant in bloom to see what you're getting. Or choose one of the following superior named selections. For blue or violet flowers, look for 'Abbeville Blue', with very showy deep blue spikes; 'Montrose Purple', a strong grower with rich violet flowers; and 'Shoal Creek', with blue-violet blossoms on spikes up to 112 feet long. Pink-flowered choices include 'Fletcher Pink', a fast grower with lavender-pink flowers, and 'Rosea', with mauve-pink blooms. White-flowered selections include 'Alba', with particularly large flower spikes, and fast-growing 'Silver Spire'. Vitex a. latifolia has  shorter, broader leaves and is said to be tougher and more cold hardy.
