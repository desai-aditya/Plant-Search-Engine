Charming little bulbs from alpine meadows of Crete, Cyprus, and Turkey. They are among the first flowers to bloom in spring; each bulb produces a stem to 6 inches high, with six-pointed, starlike blossoms in blue, white, or pink, spaced along upper part. Straight, narrow leaves are a little shorter than flower stem. In fall, plant bulbs in rich, well-drained soil, setting them 23 inches deep and 3 inches apart. When bloom quality declines, dig and divide clumps in early fall. Plantings may also increase from self-seeding. Ideal beneath deciduous trees. Resistant to rodents and deer.
