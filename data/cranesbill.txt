The common indoor/outdoor plant that most people know as geranium is, botanically, Pelargonium. Considered here are true geraniums, which are hardy plants. Many types bloom over a fairly long period, bearing flowers that are attractive, though not as showy as those of Pelargonium. Carried singly or in clusters of two or three, flowers have five overlapping petals that look alike. (Pelargonium blossoms also have five petals, but two point in one direction, the other three in the opposite direction.) Colors include rose, blue, and purple; a few are pure pink or white. The beaklike fruit that follows the flowers accounts for the common name cranesbill. Leaves are roundish or kidney shaped, with lobed or deeply cut edges; plants may be upright or trailing. Good in perennial borders; some are useful as small-scale ground covers.All of the species listed here appreciate afternoon shade and moist, well-drained soil. Clumps of most types can be left in place for many years before they decline due to crowding; at that point, divide clumps in early spring. Increase plantings by transplanting rooted portions from a clump's edge. Most types bloom heavily in spring and early summer, then go dormant when the weather gets hot in July and August. Resist browsing deer.The variety Geranium s. striatum (Geranium s. 'Prostratum', Geranium lancastriense) is a dwarf formlower and more compact and an excellent choice for rock garden or foreground. It has light pink flowers heavily veined with red (its seedlings may vary somewhat).
