Prized for their feathery foliage and showy blooms, acacia species hail from such warm-weather climes as Central and South America, Australia, Mexico, and the American Southwest. In the South, they are typically shrubs or small trees, most commonly grown in Florida and Texas. They are relatively short lived (20 to 30 years) but grow quickly, suffer from few pests, and tolerate poor and dry soils. Require excellent drainage.
