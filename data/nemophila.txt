These cool-weather annuals grow 612 inches high and trail to 1 feet wide, with saucer-shaped flowers to 1 inches across in spring. Pale green, hairy, ferny leaves give plants a delicate appearance. Often used as bulb cover. Sow seed in place in fall; plants will bloom in winter in the Coastal and Tropical South, in spring in the Upper, Middle, and Lower South.
