All are grown for their tubular, lipped flowers, which resemble those of honeysuckle (Lonicera) or salvia. Annual kinds are low plants for edgings or hanging baskets; perennial sorts are larger, vertical-growing plants with flowering stalks that rise above the foliage clumps.Compact types include 'Cambridge Blue', with green leaves and flowers in a soft pure blue; and 'Crystal Palace', with rich deep blue blossoms and bronzy green leaves. Newer strains include the heat-tolerant Magadi series, in mounding (12 by 10 inches.) and trailing (10 by 12 inches.) forms, in several shades of purple, blue, and white. Also heat tolerant is the Laguna series in various shades of blue, purple, lavender, and white. Trailing, green-foliaged kinds include the Cascade series, with carmine-red, violet-blue, blue, pink, or white blooms, and 'Sapphire', with bright blue flowers. Trailers are well suited to hanging baskets, wall plantings. They also make a graceful underplanting in containers, where the stems, loaded with flowers, can spill over the edges.
