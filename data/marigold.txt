In the 1940s and 50s, annual marigolds were America's favorite bedding plants, prized for their extended show of yellow, orange, or maroon flowers. Marigolds are the traditional flowers used in Day of the Dead celebrations. Their popularity in the South has since declined, as many newer annuals that offer more colors and better performance have come on the scene. French and African marigolds, however, are still appreciated for their mass displays in late summer and fall, when other annuals are finished blooming. And the perennial species listed here remain excellent garden plants.Native to Mexico, Central America, marigolds are free-branching plants ranging from 6 inches to 6 feet tall. Leaves are finely divided and are usually strongly scented. Easy to grow in well-drained soil. Annuals will bloom from early summer to frost if old flowers are picked off. Handsome, long-lasting cut flowers; strong aroma from leaves, stems, and blossoms permeates a room.Avoid overhead sprinkling on taller kinds; stems will sag and even break under weight of water. To make tall types stand as firmly as possible (perhaps stoutly enough to do without staking), dig planting hole extra deep, strip any leaves off lower 13 inches of stem, and plant with stripped portion below soil line.Annual marigolds are among the easiest flowers to grow from seed. Large, easy-to-handle seeds sprout in a few days in warm soil. For earlier bloom, buy nursery plants. Watch out for snails and slugs, which often devour young plants. Spider mites often attack during hot, dry weather.
