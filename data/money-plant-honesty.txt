Native to Europe. Old-fashioned garden plant grown for the translucent, 1 inches-wide circles that hang onto flower stalks; these coins are all that remains of the ripened seedpods after the outer coverings have dropped with the seeds. Reaches 13 feet high, 1 feet wide, with coarse, heart-shaped, tooth-edged leaves. Showy spring flowers resemble wild mustard blooms but are purple or white and larger in size. Plant in an out-of-the-way spot in poor soil, or use in a mixed flower bed where the shining pods can be admired before they are picked for dried arrangements. Tough and persistent; can reseed and become weedy.
