Native to China, Korea, and Japan. Common name comes from inner bark, used for making paper and Polynesian tapa cloth. Quite valuable as a shade tree where soil and climate limit choices. Tolerates heat, drought, strong winds, city            pollution, and stony, sterile, or alkaline soils.Moderate to fast growth to 50 feet., with dense, broad crown reaching 40 feet across; often considerably smaller and more shrublike in gardens. Suckering, weedy habit can be problem in rainy climates and highly cultivated gardens. Good in            rough bank plantings. Smooth gray bark can become ridged and furrowed with age, creating handsome old specimens. Heart-shaped, sometimes lobed, 4- to 8 inches leaves are green and rough textured on the upper surface, gray and velvety underneath; edges            are toothed. Blooms in spring. Flowers on male trees are catkins; on female trees, rounded flower heads are followed by red fruit if a male tree is growing nearby.
