There's a good reason why most Southerners see these flashy perennials only at the florist's: They're difficult to grow in regions with hot, rainy, humid summers and heavy clay soil. They may put on a good show for a while, but they seldom last for more than a year or two. Alstroemeria psittacina and a few new hybrids are exceptions.Heat-tolerant hybrids (Zones US, MS, LS; USDA 6-8) include 'Freedom,' with peachy red  blossoms adorned with yellowish white blotches and carmine specks; grows 2 feet tall and forms clumps to about 1 feet wide. 'Sweet Laura' is mildly fragrant, sporting golden flowers with orange petal tips and cinnamon flecks. Grows 2 feet tall; spreads slowly by underground stems. 'Casablanca' graduated from the cut flower trade to Southern gardens with 3-ft-tall, white summer blooms that are pink on the outside and freckled inside. 'Mauve Majesty' (rose with yellow throat) and 'Tangerine Tango' (golden throat with petals tipped in orange) both grow to a manageable  2 feet And for small gardens and containers in the Lower South, 'Princess Mathilde' offers coral blooms on 10 inches stems.
