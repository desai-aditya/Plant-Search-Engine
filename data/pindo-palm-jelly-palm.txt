Crowned with 510 feet, green or blue-green leaves that curve in toward the trunk, this slow- growing South American native grows 1020 feet tall, with a 1015 feet head. Long spikes of yellow flowers develop into clusters of yellow to red, edible summer fruit (flavor is sweet-tart, like an apricot-banana-pineapple blend). It is among the hardiest feather palms, taking 15F. Spent fronds hang down over the stout trunk like a hula dancer's skirt. To show off the patterned trunk, keep all these spent fronds trimmed to the same length.
