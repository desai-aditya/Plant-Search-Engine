Fragrant, trumpet-shaped summer flowers open in late afternoon, hence the common name four o'clock. Frosts kill these bushy plants to the ground, but in mild-winter areas they'll resprout from large, tuberous roots the following spring. Sow seeds in fall or spring; plants also self-sow freely. Treat as annuals in the Upper South.
