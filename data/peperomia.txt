Native to Central and South America, these perennials belong to the same family as Piper nigrumthe source of black pepper. Small and compact, they rarely exceed 1 feet in height and are grown for their highly ornamental foliage. Some are trailing, others upright; most feature stout, fleshy stems and leaves. Tiny flowers are borne on erect, cordlike spikes, usually in late summer.Peperomias are very tender to cold, with 55F being the minimum temperature they'll tolerate. Outdoors, place in light shade. Indoors, place in a bright window, but protect from hot afternoon sun, which will burn the leaves. Excellent drainage is essential, so make sure pots have adequate drainage holes. Let the soil go nearly dry between thorough waterings; feed twice a month with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer diluted to half-strength. Reduce watering and feeding in winter. Propagate by division or by taking leaf or stem cuttings in spring or summer. Frequent repotting isn't necessary peperomias prefer to be slightly pot bound.
