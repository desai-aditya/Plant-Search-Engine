Native to Japan and China. Trouble-free shrub for light shade or tough soil conditions, with interesting, showy flowers and fruit. Grows moderately fast to  6 feet tall and wide (often much more in the wild), with spreading branches that leaf out early in spring. Leaves are bright green, oval, prominently veined and toothed, to about 4 inches long and  2 inches wide. Single white flowers,  2 inches across, appear in late spring and early summer, followed  by pea-size, jet black, shiny berries, four per cluster, in fall  and persisting through winter. Fruit is quite toxic.Thin out overcrowded  mature plants by cutting back  old branches to base after flowering.
