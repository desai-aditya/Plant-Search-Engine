Mostly from North America, the many types show wide variation in form, but all have showy flower clusters. Tall kinds are excellent border plants; dwarf ones are mainstays of the rock garden. Unless otherwise noted, grow in ordinary garden soil and provide regular moisture. Two common problems affect phlox: red spider mites (attack almost all species) and powdery mildew (Phlox pani- culata is especially susceptible). Horticultural oil or insecticidal soap controls the first; planting resistant selections solves the second.Summer phlox thrives in full sun. After setting out young plants, pinch stem tips to induce branching. Mulch to keep roots cool. Divide every few years, replanting young shoots from outside of clump.Very susceptible to mildew at end of bloom season. To minimize the problem, provide good air circulation: Don't crowd plants, and thin mature plants to leave only six to eight stems. Plant mildew-resistant selections 'Blue Paradise', deep violet-blue; white-flowered 'David' and 'Mt. Fuji' ('Fujiyama'); 'Delta Snow', white with purple eye; 'Eva Cullum', pink with red eye; 'Franz Schubert', lilac-pink; 'John Fanick', light pink with darker throat; 'Laura', purple with white eye; 'Nicky', deep magenta; compact (1215 inches high) 'Pina Colada', white; 'Robert Poore', violet-pink; and 'Shortwood', bright pink with darker center. The free-blooming, disease-resistant Volcano series comes in a full range of flower colors, some with darker or contrasting centers. 'Becky Towe' has leaves edged with light gold and dark-centered, red flowers. 'Lord Clayton' has dark purple new leaves with green veins that age to bronzy purple-green; pinkish red flowers.
