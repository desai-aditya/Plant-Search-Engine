Few plants combine the colorful and bizarre as well as these natives of tropical Central and South America and the southwest Pacific. Members of this large group feature big clusters of showy bracts containing small, true flowers. In some, the clusters look like lobster claws; in others, they remind you of bird-of-paradise (Strelitzia) blossoms. Bract colors include red, orange, yellow, pink, lavender, and green. Plants form sizable clumps of large leaves and range in size from 3 feet-tall patio plants (excellent in containers) to giants reaching upwards of 15 feet Clumps expand with age, so provide sufficient room. Potted plants can bloom any time; those in the ground flower in spring and summer. Deer don't seem to care for them.Heliconias are excellent cut flowers. To extend the bloom's life, cut off the bottom 12 inches of the stem; then submerge the flowers and foliage in tepid water for an hour prior to display.Heliconias grow best with rich soil, heavy feeding, and plenty of water. They prefer acid soil; chlorosis (yellow leaves with green veins) is common in alkaline soil. During periods of active growth, give plants plenty of water and feed frequently with a balanced liquid fertilizer. Stems that have flowered should be cut away to make room for new growth. Reduce watering in cool weather. Frost will kill plants to the ground, but they will resprout from rhizomes if the cold spell is short. Where winters are cold for long periods, take potted plants indoors until spring. Smaller types can be easily stored in a garage without water or light; they will turn brown but will green up when taken outdoors once winter is over.
