'Gartenmeister Bonstedt' grows 2 feet tall and wide, with reddish bronze leaves and drooping clusters of intense orange-red, long-tubed flowers. The Angel Earrings series includes upright, semitrailing, and trailing plants with showy flowers in various combinations and white; sizes vary in height from 15 to 20 inches and in width from 20 to 40 inches.Hybrid fuchsias need porous, water-retentive soil containing plenty of organic matter; those in hanging baskets require frequent watering.
