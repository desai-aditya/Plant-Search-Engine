Tropical American natives related to philodendrons and resembling them in the glossiness and texture of their foliage. Most have cut and perforated leaves. Need rich soil. They can be grown outdoors only in the Tropical South. Indoors, direct sun in winter and bright reflected light the rest of the year are ideal; in dim light, leaves will be small and widely spaced on long, droopy stalks. If a tall potted plant gets bare at the base, replant it in a larger container along with a younger, lower plant to fill in; or cut it back and let it regrow from new shoots. Plants benefit from frequent misting.
