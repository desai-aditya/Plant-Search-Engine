This South American palm (sometimes sold under its former name, Cocos plumosa) grows 4050 feet tall, 2025 feet wide,  with an arrow-straight trunk. A common lawn and street tree throughout south Florida, though it is weak wooded and prone to breaking or toppling in storms. Arching, feathery, glossy, green fronds are 1015 feet long. White summer flowers come in drooping spikes to 3 feet long; these are followed in winter by copious quantities of decorative (though messy) yellow-orange fruit. Prefers slightly acid, well-drained soil. If grown in alkaline soil, subject to a disfiguring disease called frizzle top, caused by a deficiency of manganese or potassium. To prevent it, feed regularly with 8-4-12 palm fertilizer containing manganese. Hardy to about 26F. A hardier form, usually listed as 'Silver Queen', is a robust grower with a thicker trunk and denser canopy; reports indicate hardiness to 15F. Formerly known as Arecastrum romanzoffianum.
