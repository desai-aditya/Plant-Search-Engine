Graceful conifer, fast growing (34 feet a year) in youth. Eventually skyline tree to 100 feet tall, 30 feet wide at base, with straight, colum- nar trunk, thin red-brown bark peeling in strips. Slightly pendu- lous branches are clothed with needlelike leaves 121 inches long; foliage is soft bright green to bluish green during the growing season, brownish purple in cold weather. Roundish, red-brown cones 341 inches wide. Trees are sometimes planted in groves for Japanese garden effect; they also make a good tall screen. For holiday decorations they are soft and do not shed. Good substitute for Leyland Cypress. Not browsed by deer.
