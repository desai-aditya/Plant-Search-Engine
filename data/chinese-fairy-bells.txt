Native to both Asia and the South, these shade-loving perennials are worthy but relatively unknown additions to the woodland garden. In spring, colorful, bamboolike shoots emerge from rhizomes in shades of white, pink, purple-pink, or green. Shiny leaves are lance shaped. Fragrant spring flowers are bell shaped and dangle at the ends of the arching stems. Flowers are followed by purplish black berries. Plant in moist soil, rich in organic matter. Although many are evergreen, a cutback in early spring assures attractive new growth.
