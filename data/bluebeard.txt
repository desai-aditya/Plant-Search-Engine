Cool blue flowers top these upright Asian native shrubs from midsummer to frost. Generally grown as woody-based perennialsif plants don't freeze back in winter, cut them nearly to ground before spring growth flush to ensure a good base for the new season's growth. Bear dense, stalked clusters of small flowers on current season's growth; trim after each wave of bloom to encourage repeat flowering. Provide good drainage, since plants can rot in wet soil. Not browsed by deer.
