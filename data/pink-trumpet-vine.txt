Native to South Africa. Sprawling growth to 20 feet.; must be fastened to its support. Glossy, dark green leaves consist of two to five opposite pairs of 2 inches leaflets plus one terminal leaflet. Blooms in spring or summer, when tips of new growth produce loose clusters of 2- to 3 inches-wide, red-veined pink flowers shaped like open trumpets. Grows slowly when young, then speeds up as it matures. Likes heat, good drainage. Planting in sterilized, fertile soil is recommended in Florida, since this plant is very subject to nematode damage there.Use pink trumpet vine on posts, arbors, trellises, walls, trunks of high-branching trees. It also does well in large pots. Thin out any tangling growth in winter. Light frosts may cause leaves to drop; heavier frosts may kill vine to the ground, but regrowth is almost certain as long as soil doesn't freeze.
