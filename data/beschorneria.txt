Native to Mexico, these striking plants combine handsome, lance-shaped dark green leaves with showy, tubular summer flowers. They are related to yuccas and agaves, but they have spineless leaves and need a bit more water and shade than            their cousins. They prefer fertile, well-drained soil, though they will tolerate short periods of drought. Excellent as specimen plants, in lightly shaded borders, or in containers.
