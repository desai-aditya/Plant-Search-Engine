These plants are valued for their showy clusters of tubular flowers; their growth habit is loose, often straggling. One type has fragrant blossoms, but it is also the most tender and looks poorest after flowers are gone. The unscented,            red-flowered species are hardier and easier to grow. All appreciate well-drained soil and midday shade; very heat tolerant. To encourage compact growth, prune lightly after bloom.
