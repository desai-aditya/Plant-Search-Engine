Formerly known as Polypodium subauriculatum 'Knightiae'.  Native to tropical Asia. Gracefully drooping, fringe-edged fronds  to 3 feet or longer. Spectacular when well grown. Needs high humidity; mist frequently if growing indoors. Outdoor plants shed old fronds in spring, then quickly produce new ones.
