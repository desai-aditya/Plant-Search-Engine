Rounded, pale green, lobed leaves have a silvery look; after rain or watering, they hold beads of water on their surfaces. Summer flowers are yellowish green in large, branched clusters, attractive as a frothy mass. Use for edgings in shady places, as ground cover, and as contrast to brighter flowers. Not browsed by deer.
