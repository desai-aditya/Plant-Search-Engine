From China. Loose, spikelike clusters of 1- to 2 inches-wide white owers open from a profusion of buds resembling pearls. Flowering spans several weeks in early spring, at about the same time the roundish, 1- to 2 inches-long leaves expand.These shrubs are showy  during spring but undistinguished at other times of year, so choose your site accordingly. Prefer well-drained, acid soil but will grow in neutral or alkaline soil; will take considerable neglect. Pest free. Not browsed by deer. Flowers are formed on previous year's growth, so prune after bloom.
