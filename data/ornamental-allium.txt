About 500 species, all from the Northern Hemisphere. Relatives of the edible onion, peerless as cut flowers (fresh or dried), useful in borders; smaller kinds are effective in rock gardens. Plants bear small flowers in clusters (umbels) atop leafless stems that range from 6 inches.5 feet tall or more. Umbels may be tightly or loosely arranged; some look like spheres, others like exploding fireworks. Bloom comes in spring or summer with flowers in white and shades of pink, rose, violet, red, blue, and yellow. Most ornamental alliums are hardy, sun loving, easy to grow; they thrive in deep, rich, sandy loam. Plant bulbs in fall. Lift and divide only after they become crowded.Leaves of most alliums are narrow and upright, varying in form from grassy to strap shaped; they often begin to die back before flowering starts. Small flowers come in roundish, compact or loose clusters. Some are delightfully fragrant; those with onion odor must be bruised or cut to detect it. All alliums die to the ground after bloom, even in mild climates. Seldom browsed by deer.
