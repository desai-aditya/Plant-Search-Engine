Growers use the name epiphyllum to refer to a wide range of plantsEpiphyllum itself and a number of crosses with related plants. All are tropical (not desert) cacti, and most grow on tree branches as epiphytes, like some orchids. Grow epiphyllums indoors or in lathhouse or in shade outdoors. They require rich, quick-draining soil with plenty of sand and leaf mold, peat moss, or ground bark. Cuttings are easy to root in spring or summer. Let the base of the cutting dry for a day or two before potting it up. Overwatering and poor drainage cause bud drop.In winter, epiphyllums need protection from frost. Most have arching (to 2 feet-high), trailing stems and look best in hanging pots or baskets. Stems are long, at, smooth, quite spineless, and usually notched along edges. Spring owers range from medium size to very large (up to 10 inches across); colors include white, cream, yellow, pink, rose, lavender, scarlet, and orange. Many selections have blends of two or more colors. Feed with low-nitrogen fertilizer before and after bloom.
