Stately, attractive, densely foliaged trees that grow at a moderate rate. All have irregularly heart- shaped leaves and small, fragrant, yellowish white flowers in droop- ing clusters in late spring, early summer. Flowers develop into nutlets, each with an attached papery bract. Best in deep, rich, moist soil. In cold-winter areas, fall color varies from negligible to a good yellow. Young trees need shaping, older ones only corrective pruning. Aphids can cause honeydew, which drips disagreeably and encourages sooty mold.
