These are well-behaved, long-lived, relatively small shade trees; make fine street or lawn trees. Growth rate is slow to moderate. Very hard, tough wood. Dark green, sawtooth-edged leaves color up agreeably in fall in the Upper, Middle, and Lower South, hang on late in season. Fruits (small, hard nutlets in leaflike bracts) are carried in attractive drooping clusters to 5 inches long. Mature trees need little or no pruning.
