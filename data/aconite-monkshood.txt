Difficult plants to grow in most  of the South, as they dislike extended summer heat, drought, and mild winters. Sow seeds in moist, fertile, well-drained soil  in late summer or autumn  for flowers the following year. Seedlings started in spring may take a year to bloom. Aconite combines effectively with hosta, ferns, meadow rue (Thalictrum), and astilbe in lightly shaded gardens; it can also substitute  for delphinium in shade. Plants are seldom browsed by deer.
