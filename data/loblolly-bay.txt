Native to wet soils (loblollies)  of the Coastal Plain from Virginia to Louisiana. Narrow, erect,  rather open-structured tree to 3040 feet tall and half as wide, with shiny, oval leaves 46 inches long. Attractive flowers up to  212 inches wide bloom from midspring to midautumn; they look something like single white camellias and are enhanced by  a big central brush of yellow stamens. Although wild trees grow in bogs, those in garden conditions need good drainage. They are sometimes transplanted from the wild (with the owner's permission, of course), but these transplants are quite difficult  to grow. Easier to grow are container-grown plants from garden centers, but these too  are finicky.
