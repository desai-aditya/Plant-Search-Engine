Forms a soft-looking, airy mound about 1 feet high and 1122 feet wide; thin, branching stems are set with tiny, lance-shaped, medium green leaves. From spring through fall, whole plant is covered in small, bright yellow, star-shaped blooms with a refreshing sweet-licorice fragrance. Good choice for mixed container plantings, hanging baskets, and window boxes; also suited for  use as a small-scale ground  cover or path edging. Heat and drought tolerant.
