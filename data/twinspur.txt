South African natives related to snapdragon (Antirrhinum), bearing spikelike clusters of blossoms at stem ends from spring through early summer and often into fall. They go dormant in hot summers. Flowers are coral to purplish pink, about inches across, with two prominent spurs on the back; these spurs produce oils attractive to pollinating bees. Leaves of most types are medium green, heart shaped, from inches to 1 inches long. Not browsed by deer.Twinspurs are at their best in rock gardens, borders, and containers. With the exceptions noted, all of the species listed here are perennial, though these perennials may die in winter if planted in heavy, wet soil.
