Native to the Midwestern prairies as well as the scrublands of the Southeast, these tough, pest-free, underappreciated perennials feature tall spikes of showy, sunflower-like blooms in mid- to late summer. Broken stems exude a gummy sap that smells like pine or turpentinehence the common name rosinweed. Erect stalks holding loose, branching clusters of blooms rise from a clump of large basal leaves; stalk leaves are smaller. In most species, the foliage is rough and hairy. Plants tolerate wet or dry conditions, grow particularly well in heavy soil. Easily started from seed or grown from young transplants. Good additions to wildflower meadows, naturalized areas, and (if staked) the back of the border. Resist deer.
