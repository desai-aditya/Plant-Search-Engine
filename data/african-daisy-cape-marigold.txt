Cheery, free-blooming South African natives with daisy flowers that close when shaded, during heavy overcast, and at night. Use in broad massesas ground cover, in borders and parking strips, along rural roadsides, as filler among low shrubs. Broadcast seed where plants  are to grow; sow in early spring (or in late fall or winter, in mildest climates). Do best in light soil.  For other plants known as  African daisy, see Arctotis and Osteospermum.In north Florida, grow this species as a summer annual. In central and south Florida, it can also be grown as a winter annual, but it's susceptible to soil-borne diseases that make it short lived there. Not bothered by deer.
