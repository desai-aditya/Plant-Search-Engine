These easy-to-grow perennials resemble lupines (Lupinus). Silvery leaves are divided into leaflets that spread like fingers on a hand; erect, spikelike clusters of sweet peashaped yellow flowers appear in spring. Because of their tendency to spread by under- ground rhizomes, they are best in informal or wild gardens. Need little care. Somewhat drought tolerant.
