These old favorites are among the most versatile and useful of plants, serving as ground covers, trailers, or climbers. They bear delightfully fragrant, pinwheel-shaped blossoms in spring and early summer. Plant in well-drained soil; for lush growth, fertilize once before spring growth begins, again after flowering. Prune back as needed to shape. Cut stems exude a milky sap.
