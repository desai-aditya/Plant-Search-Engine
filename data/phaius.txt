These orchids owe their popu- larity to their attractive foliage, striking flowers, and ease of cultivation. Large, broad, rich green leaves somewhat resemble those of cast-iron plant (Aspidistra); they are marked with prominent parallel veins. Erect flower spikes to 3 feet tall arise from the bases of large, thick pseudobulbs. In the Coastal and Tropical South, Phaius species are perennials; elsewhere, they're quite easy to grow as houseplants.Although they'll take full sun for short periods, these orchids prefer light shade. Those grown indoors will bloom just fine if placed next to a bright window (they will, however, need protection from hot, direct sun). Give them fertile, well-drained soil that contains plenty of organic matter. From winter through the end of summer, keep the soil evenly moist (use room- temperature water); then let it go slightly dry for three to four weeks in fall. From spring through summer, feed every other week with water-soluble 20-20-20 fertilizer diluted to half-strength. Be careful with the leaves, which break easily. Plants are easy to divide. Scale can be a serious pest, especially on indoor plants; control it by spraying with horticultural oil.
