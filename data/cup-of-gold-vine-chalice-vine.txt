Native from Mexico to Venezuela and Colombia. Fast-growing, sprawling, rampant vine to 40 feet.; must be tied to its support. Heavy stems bear highly polished, broadly oval, rich green leaves to 6 inches long. Inflated-looking buds open to big (6- to 8 inches.), leathery, bowl-shaped, five-lobed flowers that release a coconut fragrance at night; blooms are golden yellow, with a red-brown stripe running down the inside of each lobe. Main bloom period is summer, but scattered flowering can occur at any time. Use on big walls and pergolas, along eaves, as bank cover. Spectacular along fence near swimming pool. Can be trimmed back to make a rough hedge.Give good, well-drained soil for best growth. Provide shade for roots in hottest climates. Light frost blackens the leaves, but plants usually recover to produce new growth. Cut back long, vigorous shoots to induce branching and more flowers. To make it easy to see inside the big flowers, encourage growth low on plant by tip-pinching. Pruning is best done in late winter or early spring. Often sold as S. guttata.
