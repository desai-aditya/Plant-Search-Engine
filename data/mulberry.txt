Deciduous trees with leaves of variable size and shape, often on the same tree. Yellow fall color ranges from subdued to bright. Fruit resembles miniature black- berries and is eagerly gobbled by birds.Male trees produce prodigious amounts of pollen, which can be a problem for allergy sufferers. In summer, female trees bear sweet, insipid white, pink, or purple fruit that stains pavement where it fallsand birds flock to the fruit, gorge themselves, and then proceed to sully any deck, car, driveway, or passerby unlucky enough to be below. Seedlings come up everywhere, and surface roots make it difficult to garden beneath the tree. 'Pendula' ('Teas Weeping'), is a low-growing, strongly weeping form, but a fruit producer. Fruitless (male) forms are better for home gardens, though they do produce pollen. Selections include 'Chaparral' (weeping), 'Fruitless', 'Kingan', and 'Stribling' (Mapleleaf').
