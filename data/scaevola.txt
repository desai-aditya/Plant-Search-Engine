Notable for fan-shaped blossoms, with all the segments on one side. Named for the Roman hero Mutius Scaevola, who burned off one of his hands to prove his bravery. Plants are evergreen in the Coastal and Tropical South and nearly everblooming as well. In colder regions, where they are often grown as annuals, they bloom from late spring until frost and are useful as ground covers and in hanging baskets, window boxes, and containers. Good drainage is a must. Not favored  by browsing deer.Selections feature blue, lavender-blue, purple, pink, or white blossoms. Popular 'Blue Wonder' and 'New Wonder' are lavender-blue; 'Whirlwind White' and 'White Charm' have snowy white blooms. Flowers of 'Zig Zag' sport blue and white stripes.
