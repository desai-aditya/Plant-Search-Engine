Native to North America. This low-growing member of the poppy family gets its common name from the orange-red juice that seeps from cut roots and stems. Deeply lobed, gray-green leaves reach 612 inches across. Blooms in spring, bearing lovely (but ephemeral) white or pink-tinged, 112- to 2 inches flowers carried singly on 8 inches stalks. Spreads slowly by rhizomes; good choice for damp, shaded rock gardens or woodland plantings. Combines well with ferns. Mulch in spring. Sanguinaria Canadensis multiplex 'Plena' has longer-lasting, fully double flowers.
