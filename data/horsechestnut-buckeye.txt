These trees sport long, showy, typically upright clusters of flowers atop their branches in springtime. Some develop good fall color. Leathery capsules release glossy, dark brown, chestnutlike seeds (buckeyes) in autumn. Prune established horsechestnuts only to remove dead branches. Summer leaf scorch is common when the plants are grown in poor, dry soil; severe cases result in defoliation.
