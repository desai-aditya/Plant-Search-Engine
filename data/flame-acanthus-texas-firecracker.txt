Native to southeastern Texas, northeastern Mexico. This heat-loving shrub grows 3 feet tall, 4 feet wide, with dark green leaves 2 inches long and 1 inches wide. Spikes of 2 inches-long, brilliant red-orange flowers appear from early summer to fall. These tubular, nectar-filled blooms have two lobes above the mouth, three on the lower lip. Highly favored by hummingbirds and butterflies. Fairly drought tolerant; for best growth and bloom, water deeply every 2 to 3 weeks in summer. Deer resistant, but rabbits love the new shoots; protect plants with a wire cage until a woody structure is established. For compact shape and prolific bloom, cut back by one half to two thirds before new spring growth commences. 'Mexican Flame' is a superior selection grown from cuttings.
