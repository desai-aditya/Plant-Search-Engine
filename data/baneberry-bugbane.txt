Very desirable woodland plants native to the eastern U.S. and grown chiefly for their showy flowers and berries. To thrive, these plants need moist, rich, acid, well-drained, woodsy soil and cool roots. In the South, Actaea pachypoda and Actaea rubra do best in the mountainous regions of West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. The genus Cimicifuga has recently been incorporated into spring-flowering Actaea, expanding the range of the group into warmer regions and including midsummer and fall bloomers.
