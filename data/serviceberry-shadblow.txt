Deserving of much wider use in the landscape, these graceful, airy trees and shrubs provide year-round interest. Drooping clusters of white or pinkish flowers, showy but short-lived, appear in early spring, just before or during leaf-out. They are followed in early summer by delicious blueberry-flavored fruit that is excellent for use in pies and jamsif you can beat the birds to it. Leaves are purplish in spring, turning deep green in summer and fiery hues in autumn.Excellent in woodland gardens, these plants all grow about twice as high as wide. They are easy to garden under due to their noninvasive roots and the light shade they cast. Try planting them against a dark background to better show off the flowers, form, and fall color. All need some winter chill. Rust and fireblight sometimes appear but are seldom serious. Some folks call serviceberries sarvistrees.
