From forests of the tropical Americas. Grown for their strik- ing evergreen foliagein colors varying from dark green to yellow- green and chartreuse, with variegations in white or pale cream. In the Tropical South,  will grow year-round outdoors, either potted or in the ground as accent plants. Elsewhere, grow them indoors. Young plants generally have single stems, while older ones may develop multiple stems. Taller than wide; those listed here are 12 feet wide. Mature plants bear flowers resembling odd, narrow callas (Zantedeschia).Nomenclature is somewhat confused. Some of the plants described below may be sold as selections of Dieffenbachia seguine, a highly variable species quite similar to  Dieffenbachia maculata.Give container plants fast-draining potting mix, and be sure to  let the mix dry to a depth of at least 1 inches before watering. Feed with half-strength general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer bimonthly in spring and summer. Underfed, underwatered plants show amazing endurance, recovering from severe wilting when better conditions come. Repotting is necessary when roots begin pushing plant up  out of pot. Once repotted, plants usually send out new basal shoots. Sudden change from  low to high light level will burn leaves, but you can move houseplants to a sheltered patio or  lanai in summer. If plants get leggy, you can cut them back to 6 inches above the soil line; gangly specimens cut back in this way will usually resprout with multiple stems. Or start new plants by  air layering or taking stem cuttings; discard the original, overly leggy plant. Spider mites can  be a serious pest indoors, caus- ing discolored leaves; treat  with insecticidal soap or horticultural oil (take plants outdoors  to spray).
