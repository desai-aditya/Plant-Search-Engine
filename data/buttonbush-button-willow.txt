Native to many parts of North America. This open-branched shrub grows 315 feet tall and wide, with bright green, paired or whorled leaves (26 inches long) that emerge late in spring. Creamy white, slender-tubed flowers  are crowded in rounded, 1- to  112 inches-wide heads in late summer. Blooms have projecting stigmas that give the flower clusters the appearance of a pincushion oras one nurseryman put itgolf balls with antennae. Blossoms attract butterflies. Useful for naturalizing in wet areas. To maintain good form, cut back hard in early spring. The foliage  is quite toxic to humans and livestock. 'Sputnik' has large, soft pink flowerheads.
