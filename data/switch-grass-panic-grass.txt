These bold ornamental grasses native to many parts of the U.S. can satisfy gardeners wishing to feature native plants, as well as those who simply want pretty plants. Their self-supporting, upright growth is best in full sun. Like other ornamental grasses, these stand through the winter months with dormant leaves and plumes and provide seeds for feeding birds. Cut back to the ground in late winter or early spring. Divide in spring before growth begins every three to four years or as needed. Deer resistant.
