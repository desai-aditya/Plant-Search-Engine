Native to Central and South America. Trailing evergreen plant to 1122 feet high, spreading to 6 feet or more by stems that root where they touch damp earth. Fleshy, glossy, dark green leaves to 4 inches long, half as wide, with a few coarse teeth or shallow lobes toward tips. Inch-wide flowers resembling tiny yellow zinnias or marigolds (Tagetes) bloom almost year-round. Spreads fast; easily propagated by lifting rooted pieces or placing tip cuttings in moist soil. Best in sandy, fast-draining soils but takes heavier soils if drainage is good. If killed to ground by frost, it makes a fast comeback. Tolerates high heat, seaside conditions. Can take lower light but blooms more sparsely in shady conditions. Good for erosion control on slopes: Plant 112 feet apart, feed lightly. Shear close to ground if planting mounds up or becomes stemmy. Can become invasive. Formerly known as Wedelia trilobata.
