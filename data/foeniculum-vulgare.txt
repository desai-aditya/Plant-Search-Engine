Two forms of this Mediterranean native are commonly grown. One is a perennial, popular for its licorice-flavored seeds and young leaves; the other is grown as an annual for its edible leaf bases.The plain species is a perennial (Zones US, MS, LS, CS; USDA 6-9) reaching 35 feet tall, about 112 feet wide, with finely cut yellow-green leaves and flat clusters of yellow flowers. Looks much like dill (Anethum graveolens) but is coarser in texture. Sow in light, well-drained soil; thin seedlings to 1 feet apart. Use seeds of either type to flavor baked goods; use leaves as a garnish for salads, fish. New stems grow in spring from the perennial root. Bronze fennel ('Purpurascens', 'Smokey') grows to 6 feet tall and has bronzy purple foliage; it is handsome enough to be grown as an ornamental. Fennel self-sows abundantly, unless you remove the flower heads. Foeniculum Vulgare azoricum, called Florence fennel or finocchio, is grown as a summer annual in Zones US, MS, LS, CS, TS; USDA 6-11. Lower growing than the species (to 2 feet.), with larger, thicker leafstalk bases that are used as a vegetable to be eaten cooked or raw. Remove flower buds before they open to encourage larger bulbs. 'Orion' forms especially thick, flavorful bulbs.
