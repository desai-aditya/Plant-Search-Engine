Native to Texas, New Mexico, and northern Mexico. Shrub or small, multitrunked tree, usually 1215 feet (occasionally 30 feet.) tall and not quite as wide as high. Easy-to-grow plant with appealing flowers, interesting seedpods, and lush foliage. Clusters of showy, fragrant blossoms with purplish pink petals and red anthers appear in early spring, before or with the new leaves. Flowers are followed in fall by leathery dark brown, buckeyelike seed capsules that split and drop black, shiny, 12 inches seeds. Dark green, 5- to 12 inches-long leaves with three to seven leaflets turn golden yellow in fall. Tolerates a wide range of soils, including dry, limy ones.
