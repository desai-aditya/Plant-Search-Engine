Hardy, symmetrical plants with medium-size, evergreen (except on Polystichum braunii) fronds. Among the most useful and widely planted ferns, they combine well with other plants and are easy to grow. Do best in rich, organic, well- drained soil. Use in shady beds, along house walls, in mixed woodland plantings.
