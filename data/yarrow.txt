Mainstays of the summer perennial border, yarrows offer showy blooms and finely cut, aromatic foliage. Their flat-topped flower clusters are excellent for drying. Though often considered carefree, they do require excellent drainage, especially in high-rainfall, high-humidity areas; planting in heavy clay usually results in rot. Once established, they thrive in drought and heat. Seldom browsed by deer. Cut back plants after they finish blooming. Divide and replant clumps every 3 years in late winter.Worthwhile seed-grown garden strains and hybrids include 'Apfelblte' ('Appleblossom'), 'Martina', 'Terracotta', the Summer Pastels series ('Strawberry Seduction', 'Sunny Seduction', 'Peachy Seduction'), the Summer Berries series, and the Desert Eve series.
