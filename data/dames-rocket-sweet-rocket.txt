An old-fashioned favorite for Southern cottage gardens. Freely branched plant grows to 3 feet  tall and as broad, with 4 inches., toothed leaves and rounded clusters of 12 inches., four-petaled lavender to purple blooms. Flowers resemble those of stock (Matthiola) and are fragrant at night. Plant grows readily from seed and often self-sows. Old, woody plants should be replaced by young seedlings. White- and double-flowered forms exist but are rare. Seldom damaged by browsing deer.
