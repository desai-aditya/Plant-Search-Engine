With trailing, arching stems that root where they touch soil, these plants are useful as ground and bank covers. Shiny, dark green, oval to oblong leaves. Lavender-blue, five-petaled, pinwheel-shaped flowers appear in leaf joints in early spring. Plant the larger species and its selections 2212 feet apart, dwarf kinds 112 feet apart. When plantings mound up or are layered with old stems, shear or mow before new spring growth begins. Very soil tolerant. Compete successfully with surface tree roots. Deer don't care for periwinkles.
