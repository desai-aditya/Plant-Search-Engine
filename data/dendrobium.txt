This huge genus (it may include as many as 1,400 species and even more hybrids) ranges  from Japan and the Himalayas  to Australia and the Pacific islands. Many are grown by orchid fanciers in greenhouses (outdoors in southern Florida). Some have thin, canelike pseudobulbs, others short,  fat ones. Only a few of the more widely grown are mentioned here.Culturally, dendrobiums fall into two classes. Intermediate-climate types are evergreen; they need water throughout the year (somewhat less in winter) and temperatures similar to those required by cattleya orchids. Cool growers drop some or all of their leaves during a period of winter dormancy, at which time they need very little water (only enough to keep pseudobulbs from shrinking) and temperatures suitable for green-leafed paphiopedilums.Indoors, dendrobiums need  at least 6 hours of good sunlight per day; place them directly in front of a southern window. During active growth and bloom, they need high humidity and frequent watering. Feed monthly with water-soluble 30-10-10 fertilizer. Easier to bloom in a greenhouse than a home.
