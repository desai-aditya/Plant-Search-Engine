One of Florida's most versatile landscape plants, Natal plum is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its tasty fruit. Vigor- ous, fast-growing, rounded shrub to 10 feet tall and wide, with oval, leathery, rich green leaves to 3 inches long. Native to South Africa; pre- fers the frost-free climes of south Florida but will grow as far north as Orlando with few problems. It blooms throughout the year, bearing star-shaped, five-petaled white flowers that are nearly as fragrant as those of Confederate jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides) but larger (to 2 inches across). Oval, fleshy red or purple fruits, 1112 inches long, follow the flow- ers; blossoms and fruit at various stages of ripeness often appear together. The fruit has a cranberry- like flavor and can be eaten fresh or used in jelly, sauce, or pie; be sure it is ripe before you harvest it.Natal plum is easy to grow in most soils. It's one of the very best plants for the beach, as it tolerates salt spray, wind, and sandy soil. Accepts heavy pruning and makes a superior hedge. Sharp spines along its branches discourage trespassers, so it works well as a barrier plantbut don't plant it near walkways, pools, or steps, where the spines might prove hazardous. In bright light, it can be grown as a houseplant. Not browsed by deer.
