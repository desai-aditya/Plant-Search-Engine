Native to northern China, Korea, Japan. Woody-stemmed plants with finely divided, almost ferny foliage and dense clusters of tiny, sweet peashaped flowers in spring and summer. Plants can  be killed to the ground in a hard winter, but they recover quickly from the roots and bloom on new wood. Even in mild-winter areas, they are more compact and attractive when cut back hard in late dormant season. Provide good drainage. Very heat and drought tolerant. Nearly indestructible.
