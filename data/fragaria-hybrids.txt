The genus Fragaria includes all types of strawberry plants; for those types grown strictly for their edible fruit, see Strawberry. The hybrids described here are crosses of wild strawberry with Potentilla. They spread widely by trailing runners to form a mat of rich green, glossy leaves. Leaves are made up of three oval, tooth-edged leaflets 1112 inches long; colorful, inch-wide flowers contrast beautifully with the foliage. Fruits are few and far betweenedible but not tasty. Pretty in borders, rock gardens, as edging; excellent in planters, window boxes, and hanging baskets. Grow in sandy or other well-drained soil. 'Lipstick' reaches 68 inches high, has rosy red flowers. 'Pink Panda' grows 46 inches tall and bears showy bright pink flowers from spring to fall.
