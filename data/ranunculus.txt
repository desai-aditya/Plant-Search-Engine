This very large genus comprises about 250 species of widely differing habit and appearance, but the three listed here are the ones most commonly grown in gardens. Not browsed by deer.Tuberous roots are hardy to 10F. In the Coastal and Tropical South (USDA 9-11), plant in fall for bloom in winter, early spring; treat plants as annuals there. Beyond hardiness range, plant in spring as soon as ground is workable; or start roots indoors four to six weeks before the usual last-frost date. Nurseries sell tuberous roots of various sizes; all produce equally large blossoms, but bigger roots yield a greater number of flowers.Grow in full sun, in organically enriched, very well-drained soil (if necessary, plant in raised beds). Set roots with prongs down, 2 inches deep (1 inches deep in heavier soils) and 68 inches apart. Water thoroughly, then withhold water until leaves emerge. Birds are fond of ranunculus shoots, so protect sprouting plants with netting or wire. Or start plants in pots or flats, then set them in the garden when they're 46 inches talltoo mature to appeal to birds. (You can also start with nursery-grown seedlings.) Remove faded flowers to encourage more bloom.When flowering tapers off and leaves start to yellow, stop watering the plants and allow the foliage to die back. Where tuberous roots are hardy in the ground, they can be left undisturbedas long as soil can be kept dry during summer. Some gardeners dig plants when foliage turns yellow; cut off the tops; let roots dry for a week or two; and store them in a cool, dry place until planting time. But because roots don't store that well, most people find it simpler to discard the plants and set out new roots when the time comes.
