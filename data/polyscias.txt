Like many other aralia relatives, these natives of Polynesia (except as noted) are grown for their handsomely divided leaves; flowers are unimportant and seldom produced outside the tropics. Plants appreciate warmth, humidity, and good drainage. Outdoors, they need protection from frost and mites. Often grown as hedges in south Florida. As houseplants, they are considered fussy: they need fresh, fairly still air (they cannot tolerate drafts), good light but no direct sun, and enough water but not too much. Overwatering and mite damage are the two main causes of failure. Misting is useful, along with light feeding. If plants are doing well, don't move them. They will grow slowly, maintaining their shapeliness for years.
