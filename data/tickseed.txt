These wildflowers are also known as beggar-ticks and stick-tightsreferences to their barbed seeds, which stick to the clothing or fur of anything that brushes by, allowing the plants to spread by hitchhiking. Many types of tickseed exist; most are out-and-out weeds, but a few offer showy flowers and make fine additions to the border. They prefer full sun and fertile soil that is always moist, be it boggy or well drained. Seeds planted in spring or summer sprout and grow quickly. Once planted, you'll have them forever, as they reseed profusely. Seedlings are nice to share, though, and it's easy to pull out those you don't want.Sold under a wide variety of names. Seed-grown kinds include 'Golden Eye', 1012 inches tall and broad, and 'Golden Goddess', 1122 feet high and wide, with larger (212 inches.) flowers. 'Goldie', 'Gold Marie', and 'Goldilocks Rocks' are cutting-grown plants similar in size to 'Golden Eye'.
