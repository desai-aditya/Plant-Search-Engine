All of these South African natives form handsome, fountainlike clumps of strap-shaped leaves that are evergreen in some species and selections, deciduous in others. In summer, the clumps send up bare stems ending in spherical clusters of funnel-shaped flowers, each cluster like a burst of blue or white fireworks. Some nursery plants are labeled only as blue or white; if you want a particular shade of blue, choose plants in bloom. Great in containers. Good cut flowers.Headbourne hybrids. Deciduous. Flowers in this group come in a range of blues and in white on 2 feet-tall stems above fairly narrow, rather upright foliage.Evergreen types tend to be less hardy, and (despite their description) they may become briefly deciduous in cold weather. Best in loamy soil but will grow in heavy soils. Thrive with regular water, but established plants in the ground year-round can grow and bloom without irrigation during prolonged dry periods in most areas. Mulch for winter protection in Middle and Lower South.For mass plantings, space plants 11 feet apart (use the tighter spacing for smaller varieties). Divide every 6 years or so. These are superb container plants. Good near pools. Seldom browsed by deer, but need protection from snails and slugs.
