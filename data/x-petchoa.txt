This intergeneric hybrid was created by crossing Petunia with Calibrachoa; the resulting plants possess the best traits of each parent. Like Calibrachoa, they are well branched, producing many flowering stems (no pinching needed), and their spent blooms drop off cleanly and don't stick to the foliage. Like Petunia, they produce large flowers (2 inches across) and are easy to grow. Plants are very fast growing and withstand heat, wind, and rain better than either parent. Nearly covered in flowers from late spring until frost, they reach about 1 feet high and 2 feet wide, with a semitrailing habit that makes them ideal for containers and hanging baskets. Good for planting out in beds in mild climates.The SuperCal series includes flowers in blue, cherry-red, bright rose-pink, light pink, and purple. Blooms of 'Terracotta' are yellow-orange, beautifully suffused with shades of amber and pink. 'Vanilla Blush' has soft pink flowers with a yellow throat; 'Velvet' has deep burgundy blooms, with a nearly black throat.Plants grow best in well-drained, light soil; they will tolerate alkaline and even somewhat salty soil conditions. Best with consistent moisture but will take brief periods of drought. Weekly applications of a balanced fertilizer will keep the flowers coming.
