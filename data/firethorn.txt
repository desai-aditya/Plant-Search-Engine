Grown for bright fruit, evergreen foliage (may be semievergreen in cold climates), versatility in the landscape, ease of culture. All grow fast and vigorously, varying in habit from upright to sprawling. All have glossy green, 1- to 4 inches- long, - to 1 inches-wide leaves that are generally oval or rounded at ends; all bear flowers and fruit on spurs along wood of last year's growth. Small, spring blooms are dull creamy white, carried in flattish clusters; they're effective thanks to their profusion. Nearly all species have needlelike thornsthus, the common name, firethorn.The real glory of firethorns is in their thick clusters of pea-size, orange-red berries, which light up the garden for months. Selections with red, orange, or yellow berries are available; if color is important to you, buy plants when they are in fruit. Depending on selection, berries color up from late summer to mid-autumn; some types hang on until late winter, when they are cleared out by birds, storms, or decay. Dislodge old, withered or rotted berries with a jet of water or an old broom.As shrubs and ground covers, firethorns look better and fruit more heavily if allowed to follow their natural growth habit. Prune only to check wayward branches. Plants can also be espaliered or sheared as hedges (though shearing comes at the expense of much fruit). Firethorns tolerate most soils but should not be overwatered. Two serious problems are fireblight (which can kill the plant) and scab (which causes defoliation and sooty-looking fruit); for best success, choose disease-resistant selections.
