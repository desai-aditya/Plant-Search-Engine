This fountainlike central Chinese native grows quickly to 1012 feet tall and wide. In partial shade, it has an arching form; in full sun,  it's denser and shorter. Mid- to late spring is its best season, when beauty bush is covered with clusters of 1 inches-long, yellow- throated pink flowers. Gray-green leaves to 3 inches long sometimes turn reddish in fall. Blooms heavily  in mid- to late spring, bearing clusters of 1 inches-long, yellow-throated pink flowers. Blossoms are followed by conspicuous pinkish brown, bristly fruit that prolongs color display. Brown, flaky bark gradually peels from stems during winter. An old Southern favorite. 'Pink Cloud'  is a particularly floriferous selection, bearing masses of  pink blossoms.Adapts to many soils and  climates. Blooms on wood formed the previous year. Thin out oldest stems after blossoms have faded; or, to enjoy the fruit, wait until early spring to prune, then do so lightly. Tends to get leggy with age; plant can be renewed by cutting the oldest, woodiest stems to ground  after bloom.
