Vigorous vine native from Mexico and West Indies to Uruguay. It climbs high (to 2540 feet.) and fast by hooked, clawlike, forked tendrils. Leaves divided into two oval, glossy, green leaflets to 2 inches long. Blooms in early spring, bearing yellow trumpets to 2 inches long. Vigorous; puts down roots where stems touch ground. Clings to any supportstone, wood, tree trunk. Good for covering chain-link fence. Tends to produce leaves and flowers at stem ends; after bloom, prune hard to stimulate new growth lower down. Loses all of its leaves in cold winters. May be invasive in the Coastal and Tropical South.
