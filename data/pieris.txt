Elegant in foliage and form the year around, these plants make good companions for rhododendron and azalea, to which they  are related. They have whorls of leathery, narrowly oval, glossy leaves in medium to dark green. Most plants form flower buds by autumn; these resemble strings  of tiny beads in greenish pink, red, or white and provide a subtle decorative feature during winter. Clusters of small, urn-shaped, typically white flowers open from late winter to midspring. New spring growth is often brightly colored (pink to red or bronze). Splendid in containers, in wood- land and Japanese gardens, in entryways where year-round quality is essential. Deer resistant.Same cultural requirements as rhododendron and azalea. Need acid, well-drained but moisture-retentive soil; do not thrive in hot, dry conditions. Choose a planting location sheltered from wind, where plants will get high shade or dappled sunlight at least during the warmest afternoon hours. Prune by removing spent flowers. Thin older specimens by taking out whole branches; or limb them up to reveal attractive, peeling bark.
