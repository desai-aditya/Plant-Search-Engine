An under-used beauty native to China, Korea, and Japan. Looks somewhat like a rhododendron in form and foliage. Leaves are 3-8 inches long, shiny dark green with silvery undersides and red petioles extending into the midvein. The foliage is the main attraction. Make sure you select plants with good red color; seedlings vary. Flowers are not showy; followed by small, blackish blue fruit on female plants. Grows as a rounded shrub or small tree, 1015 feet high. Plant in well-drained soil, rich in organic matter.
