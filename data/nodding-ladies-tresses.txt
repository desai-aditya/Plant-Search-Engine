Native to swamps of southeastern U.S. Forms low rosettes of dark green, 2- to 10 inches-long leaves; spreads slowly by underground rhizomes to form small colonies. In late summer and early fall, gorgeous, 1- to 2 feet-tall spikes appear atop the foliage, with small, bell-shaped, white flowers arranged spirally up and down their length. Blooms are very fragrant, like a blend of vanilla and jasmine. Easy to grow in constantly moist soil that is highly enriched with organic matter. Excellent addition to bog or streamside garden; lovely at the edge of a pond. 'Chadd's Ford' is vigorous, with large, very fragrant blooms.
