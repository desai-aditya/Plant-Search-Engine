Native to China. To 3 feet tall,  12 feet wide. Clump of coarse, deeply toothed leaves (evergreen in mild-winter climates) sends  up stalks loosely set with tubular, 3 inches-long flowers that look some- thing like big, gaping foxgloves (Digitalis). Common form bears rosy purple blossoms with a yellow throat dotted in red; there is also a fine white form with cream throat (this one must be grown from cuttings or divisions). Where winters are mild, blooms from midspring well into fall; in colder climates, bloom comes  in summer. Long lasting as a cut flower. Provide rich soil. Easy to grow from seed, root cuttings, divisions. Spreads quickly in moist, fertile soil and can be invasive.
