Native to South America, principally Chile. These fast- growing plants look good year-round in a border or as a screen. They have handsome, glossy leaves; foliage of some exudes a resinous fragrance. Clusters of small (to 1 inches.) flowers appear in summer and fall (nearly year-round in mild climates). Plants may freeze badly at 10 15F but will recover quickly. They stand up to coastal conditions and high winds and grow in most soils, except those that are highly alkaline. Prune taller types by removing one-third of old wood each year after bloom, cutting  to the base; or shape into multi- trunked trees. Tip-pinch smaller kinds to keep them compact. They can be sheared as formal hedges, but this may sacrifice some bloom. Not browsed  by deer.
