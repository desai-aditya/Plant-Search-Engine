True garden aristocrats, boxwoods may well be the world's oldest cultivated ornamental plants: They were grown as hedges in ancient Egypt and decorated the gardens of wealthy Romans during the reign of Caesar Augustus. Today,            thanks to a wide variety of shapes and sizes, the popularity of boxwoods is rising. They are still widely used as hedges, in formal foundation plantings, and as edgings for walkways and planting beds. In many areas, boxwood is the primary plant in            landscapes due to its resistance to damage by deer.These evergreen shrubs have small (just 14- to 1 inches.), lance-shaped to roundish leaves. All are easy to grow where they are adapted, provided they receive good drainage and a modicum of care. If they're grown in loose, fertile            soil that contains plenty of organic matter, heavy fertilizing is seldom necessary. Many of the more recent introductions tolerate pruning well, though most boxwoods have a naturally billowing form that requires little or no pruning. Susceptibility            to nematodes limits the use of boxwoods in Florida.
