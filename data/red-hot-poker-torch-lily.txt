Dense clumps of grasslike, finely toothed foliage send up bare stems topped by nodding, tubular flowers in tight, overlapping clusters. Flowering stems look like glowing pokers or torches, hence the common names. Blossoms open from bottom to top over the course of several days, changing color as they mature. Increasing numbers of speciesmostly from South Africaare now grown in gardens and hybridized. The old 3 feet-high forms of Kniphofia uvaria in shades of coral-orange and yellow have given way to kinds with blooms ranging from coral-red through every conceivable shade of orange, peach, and yellow to near-white and light green, on plants varying in size from 1 feet dwarfs to 6 feet giants. The flowers attract hummingbirds. Not heavily browsed by deer.Flamenco Mix. Seed-grown strain that blooms in early fall in its first year, in summer in subsequent years. Flower colors range from coral through orange and yellow to creamy white. Stems to 2 feet tall.Red-hot pokers require adequate moisture when blooms are forming and will fail to flower if conditions are too dry then. In summer, they'll tolerate even marshy conditionsbut for winter survival, well-drained soil is essential. Most of these plants flower in summer, but some start in late spring and repeat throughout the growing season. Where winter temperatures drop to 0F or below, tie foliage over clumps in fall to protect growing points (or at least leave all foliage in place over winter). In milder climates, cut or pull out any ratty-looking leaves in fall; new leaves will replace them by spring. Crowns increase slowly, forming clumps 23 feet wide (or wider) at base; you will get the best show if clumps are left in place for several years. Increase plantings by division in spring, except for types still blooming then; for these, wait until summer to divide. Protect from slugs and snails.
