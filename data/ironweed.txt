Native from Massachusetts to Mississippi and Georgia. This meadow plant is a handsome choice for the back of a border or for a contrasting color scheme with goldenrod (Solidago) and black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta). Clumps of leafy stems to 68 feet tall, 2 feet wide are topped in late summer by broad, flat clusters of fluffy, bright purple, 12 inches flower heads. These should be clipped off before they develop into the rust-colored seed clusters that give the plant its name (unless you want plants to naturalize). Grows in wet or fairly dry soils and needs no coddling. Resists deer. 'Albiflora' has white flowers.
