Native to western Mediterranean region. Resembles a giant blue fescue (Festuca glauca) but is more graceful, with bright blue-gray, narrow leaves forming a fountainlike clump 23 feet high and wide. In spring, stems to 2 feet or taller rise above foliage, bearing wispy, straw-colored flower clusters. Grows best in rich, well-drained soil. Dry soil gives the best foliage color. Attractive in borders or with boulders in rock garden. Pull out occasional withered leaves. Evergreen in mild-winter climates; semievergreen in colder areas. Rust- resistant 'Sapphire' has bluer, slightly broader leaves than species. Deer resistant.
