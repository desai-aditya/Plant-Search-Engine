Two types of fruiting persimmons are grown in the South. The native American species is a bigger, more cold-tolerant tree than its Asian counterpart, but the Asian type bears larger fruit. Neither species is fussy about soil, as long as it is well drained. For the ornamental Texas persimmon, see Diospyros texana.Prune trees when they are young to establish a good framework; thereafter, prune only to remove dead wood, shape the tree, or open up a too-dense interior. Remove any suckers that shoot up from below the graft line. Rootstock sprouts that emerge from the soil some distance from the trunk must also be removed.Fruit drop is a common problem in young trees. To avoid it, water regularly and feed once in late winter or early spring; too little or inconsistent moisture causes fruit drop, as does overfertilizing (too much fertilizer also causes excessive growth). Excessive fruit drop can also be reduced by providing a pollenizer (such as 'Gailey'), but fruit will be seedy.Some Japanese persimmon selections are astringent until soft-ripeat which stage they become very sweet. To save the crop from birds, pick fruit when fully colored but still hard, then let it ripen off the tree. Astringent types must be eaten when the flesh is mushy and puddinglike. Nonastringent types are hard (like apples) when ripe, with a mildly sweet flavor; they can be eaten hard, but their flavor improves when they are allowed to soften slightly off the tree.
