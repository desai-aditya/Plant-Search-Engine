Native to South Africa. Branching stems of this South African native make a sprawling clump to 1 feet high, 23 feet wide. Leaves are fleshy, bright green, and shaped like slender, pointed pencils. Blooms through most of the year, producing spikelike, 6- to 12 inches clusters of tubular, bright yellow flowers resembling those of  or (Kniphofia). 'Hallmark' has orange flowers with fuzzy yellow stamens; it is more compact, less heat tolerant than species. 'Tiny Tangerine' is another compact, orange- flowered selection. All are useful as ground or bank cover in dry, well-drained soil. Leaves are slippery when crushed, so don't locate them where they'll be stepped on.
