For sheer spectacle and exuberance, no flowering vines surpass bougainvilleas. Native to Central and South America, they're common in Florida, South Texas, and along the Gulf and south Atlantic coasts. And with the advent of            low-growing, shrubby types that can be bought in full bloom and grown in containers, more Southerners can enjoy these plants than ever before. Established vines with- stand light frosts, but plan to take the plants indoors to a sunny window for the            winter if you live where temperatures drop below 20F.Bougainvillea's vibrant colors come not from its small, inconspicuous true flowers, but from the three large bracts that surround them. Heaviest bloom comes during the cooler months of spring and fall, when days and nights are            nearly equal in length. Plants go dormant in summer. Both single- and double-flowering kinds are sold; double sorts can look messy, as they hold faded blooms for a long time.These vines are fast, vigorous growers, reaching 1530 feet., depending on the selection. Stiff stems are armed with long, needlelike thorns and are moderately to densely clothed in medium green, 212 inches., heart-shaped leaves.            Bougainvilleas are superb trained against walls or on sturdy fences, trellises, or arbors. They have no means of attachment (though their thorns help them scramble through shrubs and trees), so you must tie stems to the support while the vine is            young.
