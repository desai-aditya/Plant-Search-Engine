Longtime favorites for colorful, round flowers, typically in summer and early fall. Butterflies love them. These are hot-weather plants that don't gain from being planted early; they stand still until weather warms up. Subject to mildew in humid places, if given overhead water, and when autumn brings longer nights, more dew and shade. Moderately resistant to damage by browsing deer. Sow seeds where plants are to grow (or set out nursery plants) from late spring to early summer. Give good garden soil, feed generously. Most garden zinnias belong to Zinnia elegans.Among smaller strains (to about 1 feet.) for edging or foreground are Dasher, very quick to bloom; bushy Dreamland; and large-flowered Magellan and Peter Pan.
