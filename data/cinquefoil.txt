Hardy plants useful for ground covers and borders, with bright green or gray-green leaves divided into small leaflets. Small, roselike, typically single flowers come in white; cream; and soft to bright shades of pink, red, yellow, and orange. Cinquefoils typically prefer cool nights and cool soils. Deer don't usually bother them.Evergreen PerennialsThese include creeping plants used as ground covers as well as sturdy, clumping types for rock gardens or perennial borders. Leaves are divided fanwise into leaflets and are reminiscent of strawberry foliage; flowers are generally about 1 inches wide.Deciduous ShrubsThe shrubby potentillas, most often sold as named forms of bush cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa), are native to northern latitudes everywhere. They perform well in Zones US, MS; USDA 6-7. All have leaves divided into three to seven leaflets; some are distinctly green on top, gray beneath, while others look more gray-green all over. All bloom cheerfully from late spring to early fall.Fairly trouble free. Best in well-drained soil with moderate water, but tolerate poor soils, limestone, drought, heat. Selections with red or orange tinting should be grown in light shade, since they tend to fade quickly in hot sun. After bloom period ends, cut out older stems from time to time to make room for new growth. Here are some of the selections found in garden centers.
