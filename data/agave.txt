Superb as accents, focal points, or in combination with plants of contrasting texture, agaves command attention with their large, fleshy, straplike leaves and tall, unearthly looking blossom spikes. Flowering is sporadic, however, and may not occur for years. The original plant dies after it blooms, leaving offshoots that make new plants.Gardeners familiar with diverse succulents will note that the former Manfreda genus has been merged with Agave. These agaves look like crosses between century plant (Agave) and tuberose (Polianthes). Unlike other agaves, they do not die after blooming. Long, mostly spineless, succulent leaves grow in a rosette from a bulbous base. Flower spikes are tall and sturdy, requiring no staking. The blooms are conversation pieces, good for cut flowers, and appealing to hummingbirds.The species described here are all easy to grow in well-drained soil. Good in rock gardens and containers.Like all succulents, agaves tolerate drought but demand excellent drainage. They grow well in containers and are not browsed by deer. Most are tender, but some species withstand freezing weather. Wet soil in winter decreases hardiness. Good plants for coastal gardens.
