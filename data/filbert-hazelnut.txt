Although lberts and hazelnuts are usually thought of as trees grown for their edible nuts, most listed here are grown for their pleasing ornamental value. Plants have separate female and male owers; female blossoms are inconspicuous, while male ones, appearing in pendent catkins on bare branches in winter or early spring, are showy. Leaves are roundish to oval, with toothed margins.
