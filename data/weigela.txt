Few shrubs have seen such dramatic improvements in the past decade as weigelas. What were previously dismissed as ho- hum, one-season wonders have magically morphed into delightful forms that offer colorful foliage, a variety of flower colors, compact growth, and repeat blooming. Profuse display of inch-long, funnel-shaped flowers occurs in spring. Use these Asian natives in mixed borders or in sweeps.Sonic Bloom series. Heavy bloom in spring, with repeated flushes of flowers until frost. Available in lipstick-red, hot pink, and pink-flushed white. Compact growth to 45 feet tall and wide.Provide moderately fertile, well-drained soil for best growth. Larger selections can become rangy with time if not pruned. After flowering, cut back stems that bloomed to side shoots that didn't bloom. Cut some of the oldest, woodiest stems to the ground; vigorous new growth will quickly replace them. Compact selections need only occasional pruning. Spring-blooming types will flower again the following spring. Repeat bloomers will flower again that same year in summer.
