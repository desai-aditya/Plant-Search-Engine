Small, rosette-forming succulents from South Africa. Many types produce offsets to form dense, spreading colonies. Fleshy leaves may be slender and rough textured or pillowlike and smooth; some have small white bumps or ridges. Tiny flowers are held on long, whiplike stems from spring to late fall; these may be clipped off as they fade to keep plants tidy.Haworthias are well suited to containers, and their small size and tolerance of low humidity make them good houseplants. In pots or in the ground, provide sandy, fast-draining soil that is allowed to dry out between waterings. Protect from frost and hot sun. Acclimate nursery plants to the garden gradually, or the leaves may sunburn. Numerous species and hybrids make these variable plants popular with collectors.
