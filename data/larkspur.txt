The colorful spires of larkspur punctuate many a Southerner's garden in spring. Unlike their regal cousins, the delphiniums, these natives of southern Europe flourish in the hot Southern climate. They die after flowering but reseed so readily that they might as well be perennials. The blooms attract butterflies and make superb cut flowers. Larkspurs look great in combination with Shirley poppies (Papaver rhoeas).Plants grow 15 feet tall, about 1 feet wide. Flowers (double on most types) are up to 1 inches wide, borne on vertical spikes above deeply cut, almost fernlike leaves; blossom colors include blue, lilac, purple, pink, rose, salmon, and white. Improved strains branch at the base, producing several flower spikes per stalk. Disease-resistant Cannes Mix strain produces sturdy stems of double, tightly packed flowers to 45 feet tall. Great cut flower in a wide range of single and bicolor shades. Giant Imperial strain bears 4- to 5 feet-tall stalks of double, densely packed blossoms; Regal strain features thick spikes of large flowers similar to delphiniums, grows 45 feet tall. Super Imperial strain produces cone-shaped spikes to 1 feet tall. Heat-tolerant Steeplechase strain, 45 feet tall, bears the largest flowers of all.Of course, some folks prefer the simpler, unimproved larkspurs of their childhoods. Heirloom types include the following.Plant seeds in fall where plants are to grow; sow them on bare soil and barely scratch in (do not mulch over them). For greatest impact, sow in large clusters or sweeps. After flowers fade, allow seeds to drop naturally for a casual look; or collect and store them for fall sowing.
