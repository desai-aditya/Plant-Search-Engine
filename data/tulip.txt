No other spring bulb matches the tulip for sheer spectacle. Tulips come in just about every color; their imposing flowers atop strong stems form the backbone of many a spring garden display. If you've only tried the big-flowered sorts, though, you're missing out on a lot. Many kinds are available, from the tall and stately to the dainty and whimsicaland even to the decidedly bizarre. In fact, many of the smaller, lesser-known species perform better in the South than their aristocratic cousins.Large-flowered tulips, such as the Darwin hybrids, are ideal for sweeps and borders; mass at least 50 of a single color for impact. Plant them behind low, spring-blooming perennials such as candytuft (Iberis) or pinks (Dianthus), or with annuals such as forget-me-nots (Myosotis), sweet alyssum (Lobularia), or pansies and violas (Viola). Plant smaller, lower-growing species in rock gardens, raised beds, and alongside paths. Tulips are superb container plants; especially lovely in this role are the more unusual kinds, such as the Double Early, Parrot, and Rembrandt types.Tulips have been classified into many divisions, defined mainly by flower type. For the convenience of gardeners, we have arranged the divisions into additional groupings; the first three are by bloom season, while the fourth contains species and their hybrids. For most divisions, we've also included best betsselections that perform especially well in the South.EARLY TULIPSMIDSEASON TULIPSLATE TULIPSSPECIES TULIPS
