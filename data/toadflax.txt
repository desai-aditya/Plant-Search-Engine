Brightly colored flowers resemble small, spurred snapdragons (Antirrhinum majus). Easy to grow; thrive in light or sandy soil. Look best when planted in masses, as individual plants are rather wispy. Toadflaxes are not usually browsed by deer.Seed baby snapdragon in quantity for a show. It performs best during cool weather. Where winters are cold, sow in early spring after danger of frost is past, then again in late summer; in mild-winter areas, sow in late summer for fall bloom, then again in autumn for winter flowers.
