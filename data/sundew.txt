These bizarre plants inhabit bogs in many parts of the world. Leaves vary from narrow and arching to almost round, but all are covered with small hairs that hold drops of sticky liquid. These hairs trap and digest the insects that land on them, providing nutrients not found in the soil where it grows. All species bear small, five-petaled flowers.Care for sundews as you would Venus's flytrap (Dionaea muscipula); the two can be grown indoors and make good companions for a terrarium. Outdoors, they thrive in full sun and constantly moist, peaty soil. Be sure to purchase only nursery-propagated plants that are grown from seed, division, or tissue culture; buying wild-collected plants depletes native populations.
