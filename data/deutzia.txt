These shrubs are best used among evergreens, where they can make a show with their small, often fragrant flowers, then blend back in with other greenery later on. Bloom season coincides with that of late spring bulbs such as tulips and Dutch iris. Prune as soon as flowers fade. With low- or medium-growing kinds, cut some of oldest stems to ground every other year. With tall kinds, prune heavily each year after bloom, cutting back wood that has flowered to outward-facing branches. Tough, easy to grow. Not browsed by deer.
