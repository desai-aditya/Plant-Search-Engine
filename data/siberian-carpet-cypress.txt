Native to Siberian mountains and hardy to any amount of cold, this neat, sprawling shrub resembles a trailing  (Thuja). Grows 112 feet tall, 78 feet wide, with many plumy, horizontal or trailing branches closely set with scalelike leaves. Foliage is green in summer, turning purplish or reddish brown in winter. More shade tolerant than junipers (Juniperus). Needs excellent drainage. 'Fuzz Ball' has softer- textured new growth and more open habit to 3 feet high and 4 feet wide. Use as a bank cover.
