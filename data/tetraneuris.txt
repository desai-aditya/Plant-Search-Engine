Taprooted plants with narrow, grassy, aromatic leaves that form small, evergreen foliage tufts about 8 inches high, 1 feet wide. Somewhat reminiscent of thrift (Armeria). Blooms during warm months (nearly all year in mild-winter climates). Yellow daisies to 112 inches wide have rays with notched edges; blossoms are usually carried singly on stems. Give well-drained soil. Cut off faded flower spikes to neaten plants and prolong bloom. Tolerant of heat, cold, drought. With some moisture, will reseed. Attractive in containers.
