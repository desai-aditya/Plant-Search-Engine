Excellent ornamental shrubs with clusters of small, bell-shaped spring flowers and colorful, edible fruit that attracts birds. Species described here are shrubs ranging from ground covers to  the height of a small treethat are grown for decorative, landscaping use; see Blueberry for relatives grown primarily for their edible fruit. All require rich, organic, acid soil. Good for woodland gardens.
