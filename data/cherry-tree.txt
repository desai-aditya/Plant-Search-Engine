If George Washington indeed chopped down a cherry tree, it was probably because he was miffed about not getting any fruit. Fruiting cherries, both sweet and sour types, make attractive trees for the home garden, but getting a decent crop is a challenge in the South. For strictly ornamental cherries, see Prunus.The worst single problem for sweet cherries grown in the South is bacterial canker. Gardeners should check with their local Cooperative Extension Offices for recommended methods of control.In the past, many gardeners stayed away from sweet cherries, because the trees are naturally large (to 35 feet high and wide), and most need cross-pollination, so they have to plant two. But breeding advances have produced many self-fruitful varieties (noted in descriptions) and much smaller sizes.For selections that need pollinators to produce fruit, the second tree must be chosen with care. No combination of these will produce fruit: 'Bing', 'Lambert', 'Royal Ann'. However, the following selections will pollinate any other cherry: 'Angela', 'Black Tartarian', 'Hedelfingen', 'Stella', and 'Van'. Self-fertile types (a lone tree will bear) are noted in the descriptions.Good selections include the following:The newly introduced German dwarfing rootstocks ('Gisela 5' and 'Gisela 6') now provide gardeners with smaller sweet cherry trees that are easier to manage. Self-fruitful selections now available on these rootstocks include 'Sandra Rose', 'Barton', and 'Stardust'. Some of these may prove satisfactory in the South.
