These graceful plants combine showy flowers and handsome, fernlike foliage. Small blossoms in white, pink, peach, rose, red, or purple appear in airy, feathery plumes held by thin, wiry stems ranging in length from 6 inches to 3 feet or more. Most grow 23 feet wide.Astilbes are the mainstay of shady borders in the Upper and Middle South but can take some sun in the Upper South if given plenty of water. Combine with columbine (Aquilegia), meadow rue (Thalictrum), hosta, and epimedium in shady borders, or with peonies (Paeonia), delphinium, and irises in sunnier spots. Effective at the edge of ponds, along shady paths, in mass plantings, and in pots. Seldom browsed by deer.All astilbes need moist, well- drained soil with ample organic  matter. Cut off faded flower stems. Divide clumps every 4 to 5 years in autumn or in early spring.Growing astilbes in the Lower South is challenging, to say the least. Give them rich, well-drained soil, full shade, and plenty of water. If they dry out in summer, the party's over.
