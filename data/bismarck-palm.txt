From Madagascar, this striking palm grows 30 to 40 feet tall; comes in blue and green forms. The fan-shaped fronds are each up to 10 feet wide, making a round leaf crown about 25 feet wide. The blue form is better inland because            it's more tolerant of heat and cold, while the frost-intolerant green form excels along the coast. Grow where its low, stout trunk and shapely canopy can show off, as in rows along a driveway or as accent in a lawn.
