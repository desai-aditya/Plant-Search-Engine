Once found in most of the continental U.S., these slender-leafed, upright, clumping native grasses formed a predominant part of old tall- and short-grass prairies. Big bluestem made waves of rippling green, sometimes nearly twice as tall as the settlers. Plant in drifts or masses; for erosion control; as airy vertical accents in flower or shrub borders; or in a natural garden with sunflowers (Helianthus), golden rod (Solidago), and coreopsis. Be sure to divide clumps every few years when centers start to die; discard the center and replant vigorous young clumps from the edge. Every year, shear dried stems to base before new growth begins in spring.
