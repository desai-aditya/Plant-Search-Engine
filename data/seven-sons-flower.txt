From China. Handsome fountain-shaped shrub to 1520 feet tall, 810 feet wide. Large, narrowly heart-shaped leaves are shiny green, deeply veined. Fragrant, creamy white flowers in 6 inches-long clusters at branch ends open over a long bloom season in late summer and fall. Blooms are succeeded by even showier masses of small fruit with bright purplish red calyxes. Common name derives from the number of flowers in each of the clusters forming part of the larger inflorescence. Picturesque even in winter, when bark is on show: Thin, pale tan strips peel away to reveal dark brown bark beneath. Not fussy about soil; not bothered by pests or diseases. Can be trained as a single- or multitrunked tree.
