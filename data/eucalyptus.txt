Prized for their beautiful foliage, these fast-growing plants are also famously drought tolerant. Most are native to Australia. Lack of cold hardiness limits their use in the South. Sudden freezes or hard winters may kill fairly large trees to the ground or kill them outright. For this reason, some Southerners grow them as annuals or herba- ceous perennials for summer color. Still, some species are surprisingly hardy; they are listed here. None is bothered by deer.Outside of prime eucalyptus territory, you may wish to try your hand at growing the plants if you enjoy experimenting. Plants are easily started from seed; most grow very rapidly, perhaps as much as 1015 feet in 1 year. Some are large trees with great skyline value; some are medium to large shrubs or multitrunked trees. Most bear small white or cream owers that are conspicuous only in masses, while others have colorful, showy blooms. Some have leaves of unusual form, highly valued in oral arrangements. Nearly all have foliage that is aromatic when crushed. Most have two different kinds of leaves; those on young plants or new growth differ markedly from mature foliage.The sizes listed for trees below apply to plants grown in the Coastal and Tropical South; plants grown elsewhere are unlikely to reach such heights. Hardiness gures are not absolute. In addition to air temperature, you must take into account the plant's age (generally, the older the hardier), its condition, and the timing of the frost (24F following several light frosts is not as dangerous as the same low temperature following warm autumn and winter weather). Consider any eucalyptus a risk; occasional deep or prolonged freezes can kill even large trees. If you are committed to growing eucalyptus, don't hasten to remove apparently dead trees; although their appearance may be damaged, they could resprout from trunk or main branches.
