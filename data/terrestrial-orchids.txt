Native to high altitudes in Southeast Asia, where rainfall is heavy and nights cool. Very popular because of their relatively easy culture. Except in frost-free areas, grow plants in containers in greenhouse or sunroom, or under overhang or high-branching tree. Long, narrow, grasslike leaves form a sheath around short, stout, oval pseudobulbs. Long-lasting owers grow on erect or arching spikes and make excellent cut owers. Standard types usually bloom from February to early May. Bloom season for miniatures starts in September and is usually heaviest from November to January.Cymbidium growers typically list only hybrids in their catalogslarge-owered selections with white, pink, yellow, green, or bronze blooms. Most have a yellow throat and dark red markings on lip. Large-owered forms produce a dozen or more 412- to 5 inches owers per stem. Plants reach 23 feet high. Miniature selections, about a quarter the size of large-owered forms, are popular for their smaller size and free-blooming qualities.
