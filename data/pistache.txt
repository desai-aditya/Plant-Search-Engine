Though the nut-bearing Pistacia vera is the best-known pistachio, the two ornamental species described here (Pistacia chinensis and  Pistacia texana) are far more useful in most of the South. Leaves are divided into leaflets; flowers are insignificant. Trees may be either male or female; if a male is nearby, females bear clusters of tiny fruit in fall. Young trees tend to be irregular in form and benefit from early training and pruning.Plant in full sun for best growth and fall color. Tolerates almost any well-drained soil. Quite drought tolerant and pest-resistant. Also tolerates pollution, making it a good choice for urban settings. Its filtered shade allows grass to grow beneath it.When planting, avoid rough handling; budded tops are easily broken away from rootstock. Pistachios are inclined to spread and droop; stake them and train branches to good framework of four or five limbs beginning at 4 feet above ground. Established trees need little watering. Full sun.
