Native to Japan. Slow grower to 10 feet tall and about as wide, with slender, polished-looking, chestnut-brown branches. Pendulous, 3- to 4 inches-long flower stalks, each carrying 12 to 20 buds, hang like strings of pearls from branches in fall and winter. In late winter, buds open into bell-shaped, pale yellow or greenish yellow flowers, 13 inches wide. Greenish yellow, berrylike fruit follows in late summer. Bright green, toothed leaves are 37 inches long and oval, tapering to sharp tip; foliage is often somewhat sparse. Rosy red and yellowish fall color is pleasant but not spectacular. Provide moist, acid, well-drained soil.
