Most are striking bold-leafed plants that may eventually grow to 2530 feet tall under ideal conditions. Not for small gardens. Often shrublike and multistemmed (because of suckering habit), especially in colder areas, where they may grow just 10 feet high. Clumps range from one-half to almost as wide as they are tall. Branches are nearly vertical or slightly spreading, usually very spiny. Huge leaves, clustered at ends of branches and divided into many leaflets, look quite exotic. White mid-summer flowers, small but in such large, branched clusters that they are showy, are followed by berrylike, purplish fruit that is enjoyed by birds.Grow in well-drained soil. Not good near walkways because of spines; even leafstalks are sometimes prickly. Wind can burn the foliage, so provide a sheltered location. Need minimal pruning; dig out suckers to limit spread of clump.
