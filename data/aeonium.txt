Most aeoniums are native to the Canary Islands. Their fleshy leaves are held in rosettes at branch tips. After several years, rosettes produce a single large flower stalk in spring or summer; branches that have flowered die. These cool-season growers go dormant in summer to save water. During dormancy, they may appear sick and lose leavesbut when the weather cools and the plants get water, they perk up and regrow leaves.
