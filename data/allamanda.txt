From Tropical South and Central America. These plants have striking foliage and trumpet-shaped flowers (borne nearly year-round). Plant permanently outdoors only in the mildest climates. Elsewhere, grow as summer-blooming potted plants; keep indoors during cold weather. They tolerate very little frost and need heat for proper growth and bloom; warm nights and warm days are necessary. Remove spent flowers for increased bloom.
