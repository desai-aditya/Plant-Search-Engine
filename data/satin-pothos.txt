Resembles more familiar green- and-yellow pothos (Epipremnum aureum; also sold as Scindapsus aureus) but has dark green leaves with gray-green mottling. Leaves are also thinner in texture and usually somewhat larger (to 6 inches., compared with the 2- to 4 inches leaves of pot-grown pothos). Flowers are insignificant. All plant parts are poisonous, and the sap can cause a skin rash. The most frequently grown selection is 'Argyraeus', with silky-sheened leaves carrying almost silvery markings that are more prominent and larger than those of the species.Satin pothos is fussier than pothos: needs perfect drainage, high humidity, and good light but no direct sun. Water as soon as soil becomes dry to the touch; feed every other week with a general-purpose liquid fertilizer. In winter, reduce watering and cease fertilizing.
