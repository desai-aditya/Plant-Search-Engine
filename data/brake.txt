Small evergreen ferns of sub- tropical origin. They are mostly used as houseplants, but the ones listed here will also grow outdoors. Indoors, they should be sited in bright light but shielded from hot sun; an east-facing window is ideal. They benefit from frequent misting. Provide good drainage; keep the soil evenly moist. Fertilize every 2 weeks during spring and summer and once monthly in fall and winter with a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer.
