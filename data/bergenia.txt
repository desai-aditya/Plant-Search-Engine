Native to the Himalayas and the mountains of China. Thick rootstocks produce rosettes of ornamental, glossy green leaves to 1 feet across. Evergreen except in the coldest areas; foliage of many types blushes red in cool weather. Thick,            leafless, 1- to 112 feet-tall stalks bear graceful, nodding clusters of small white, pink, or rose flowers shaped like funnels or bells; blossoms are typically 12 1 inches across. Bergenias lend a strong, substantial textural quality to borders            and plantings under trees; also make a bold, patterned ground cover. Effective with ferns, hostas, hellebores; good as foreground planting for aucubas, rhododendrons, Japanese yew (Taxus cuspidata).Bergenias do well in part shade in the Upper and Middle South, full shade in Lower South. Plant about 112 feet apart. They do best in good soil with regular watering, good drainage, feeding, and periodic grooming. Cut back yearly to            prevent legginess. Divide crowded clumps and replant vigorous divisions in late winter or early spring.
