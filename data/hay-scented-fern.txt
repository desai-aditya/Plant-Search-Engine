Native from eastern Canada to the Midsouth. Deciduous fern with nely divided yellow-green fronds to 2 feet tall arising from creeping rhizomes. Plant spreads quickly to make an attractive ground cover. Crushed fronds smell like freshly cut hay. If given adequate water, thrives even in poor, rocky soil. Can form mats that cover rocks. You may see it growing along the roadside or under rail fences in partly shaded areas.
