All are large, with heavy trunk (or trunks) and sculptural branch pattern. Older bark sheds in irregular patches to reveal creamy, smooth new bark beneath. Big, rough-surfaced, bright green leaves (to 10 inches across) have three to five lobes, resemble maple (Acer) leaves. Fall foliage color is yellowish to brown, not striking. Ball-shaped brown seed clusters, usually on threadlike stalks, hang on the bare branches through winter; these are prized for winter arrangements. Plane trees do best in rich, deep, moist, well-drained soil. All are subject to anthracnose, which causes early leaf drop and twig dieback. Rake up and dispose of dead leaves, since fungus spores can overwinter on them.
