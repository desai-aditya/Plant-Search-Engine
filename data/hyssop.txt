This compact southern European herb grows 2 feet high, 3 feet wide, with narrow, glossy, dark green leaves on woody-based stems. Foliage has a pungent scent and a peppery taste; sometimes used in cooking. Profusion of dark blue flower spikes appears throughout summer and into autumn; not a dramatic show but pleasing. 'Rosea' has pink blooms; selections with white and lavender blooms also exist.Start from seed sown in early spring or stem cuttings in late spring or early summer. Once established, it may self-sow. Takes some drought but will thrive with regular moisture if drainage is good. Tolerates trimming as a low hedge or as border for a knot garden.
