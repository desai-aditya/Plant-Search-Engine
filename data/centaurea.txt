Annual forms of Centaurea are grown mainly for cut flowers; perennial kinds are valued principally for their soft, silvery foliage. All are relatively easy to grow. For best performance,  add lime to acid soils. In most cases, plan to sow seeds of annuals or set out plants of perennial kinds in spring (or in  fall, in mild-winter areas).
