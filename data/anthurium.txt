Native to tropical American rain forests, these exotic-looking plants are prized for their large, often glossy leaves and distinctive flowers (a large, flattish bract surrounding a slender, fleshy spike). Among the species listed here, all but Anthurium hookeri are usually grown as potted plants, even in tropical climates. Anthuriums, sometimes called flamingo flowers, make unusual houseplants in cooler climates.
