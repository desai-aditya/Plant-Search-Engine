Once classified with eastern American silver bell (Halesia), to which they are related, these trees make handsome, interesting garden specimens. White flower clusters appear in late spring or early summer. Slim petals show from behind alternate leaves; plant where you can look up into themon a bank beside a path, above a bench, in a raised bed. These are choice plants for the woodland edge or as a focal point in a large shrub border. Established trees need little pruning.
