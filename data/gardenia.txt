No plant expresses the grace of the South better than gardenia. Intensely fragrant white blossoms contrast beautifully with shiny, leathery, dark green leaves. Double forms are a classic choice for corsages.Gardenias are lovely in flower borders and also do well in large pots on decks and patios; gardeners in cold-winter areas can grow them in cool greenhouses.The many selections are useful in containers or raised beds, as hedges, espaliers, low screens, or single plants.Provide fast-draining but moisture- retentive, acidic soil containing lots of organic matter. Plant gardenias high (like azaleas and rhododendrons) and don't let them be crowded by other plants or competing roots. To suppress weeds, mulch plants instead of cultivating around them. Feed every 3 to 4 weeks during the growing season with acid fertilizer, fish emulsion, or blood meal. Prune to remove straggly branches and faded flowers. Control whiteflies, aphids, and other sucking insects with light horticultural oil. Mag- nesium deficiency can result in yellow leaves with green veins; treat by dissolving one tablespoon of Epsom salt in a gallon of water and soaking the root zone (best done in early spring). Though you can grow gardenia as a houseplant, doing so can be pure torture: Mealybugs, mites, and whiteflies love it.
