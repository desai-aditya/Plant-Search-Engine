Native to eastern U.S. Useful and attractive native plant for ground cover or foreground planting. Grows 810 inches tall and spreads freely by underground rhizomes. Bright green, toothed leaves, 13 inches long, make a good background for the bright yellow flower heads. Blossoms have five rays, resemble stars more than daisies. Bloom is heavy in spring and fall, sporadic through summer months. For quick ground cover, plant 1 feet apart in rich soil high in organic matter. 'Allen Bush' is an excellent selection with dark green leaves. 'Eco Lacquered Spider' has long runners (to 3 feet.) that radiate from the center of the plant like spider legs. 'Pierre' forms compact clumps just 6 inches tall; it blooms over a long period. Chrysogonum Virginianum australe is a more prostrate form with shorter stems. Its flowers aren't as showy as those of the species, and it spreads by above ground stolons or runners (much as strawberry plants do) rather than rhizomes.
