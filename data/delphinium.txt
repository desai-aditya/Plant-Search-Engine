Often associated with the grand borders of England, stately delphiniums are problematic in most of the South. Those fancy hybrids (such as Delphinium elatum hybrids) can't take our long, hot, humid summers and seldom last more than a year or two; in fact, they're best treated as annuals. Native species may be less spectacular than the hybrids, but they are reliably perennial, rising up in the garden year after year.Like Pacic strain but shorter (22 feet tall) are the Blue Fountains, Blue Springs, and Magic Fountains strains. Even shorter is the Stand Up strain (1520 inches.). These shorter strains seldom require staking.Other strains have owers in shades of lilac-pink to deep raspberry-rose, clear lilac, lavender, royal purple, and darkest violet.Delphiniums are easy to grow from seed. In the Middle, Lower, and Coastal South, sow fresh seed in flats or pots filled with potting soil in July or August; set out transplants in October for bloom in late spring and early summer. In the Upper South, sow seed in March or April, and set out transplants in June or July for first bloom by September (and more bloom the following spring).Plants need rich, porous soil and regular feeding. Improve poor or heavy soils by working in lots of organic matter. Add lime to strongly acid soils. Work a handful of superphosphate into the soil around the root ball. Be careful not to bury the plant's root crown.When new stalks appear in spring, remove all but the strongest two or three, tie to stakes, and apply a bloom-booster  fertilizer. After blooms fade, cut stalks nearly to the ground,  leaving foliage at the bottom. Fertilize again, and you may get  a second bloom.
