Native to tropical Americas and Africa. Ornamental leaves, beautifully marked in shades of green, white, and pink, arranged in basal tufts. Flowers of most are inconspicuous. Need high humidity and warm air (not under 55F). Succeed outdoors in south Florida; elsewhere, they are greenhouse or indoor plants that can be brought outdoors in summer. Need porous soil, perfect drainage, frequent misting in dry air. Repot as often as necessary to avoid root-bound condition. Calatheas are often mistakenly called marantas.
