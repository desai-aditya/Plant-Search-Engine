This central European native starts as a foot-wide rosette of finely cut leaves covered with silky hairs; smaller leaves clothe the short flowering stems. In early spring, each stem is topped by a single cup-shaped, erect or nodding blossom with silky hairs on the outside and a mass of yellow stamens within. Colors range from white through pink shades to purple or red. The fluffy seed clusters are almost as showy as the flowers; each seed is topped by a long, twisting, feathery appendage. Plants grow from a woody root, reach 56 inches high in bloom, rise to about 112 feet high by the time seeds appear. 'Pinwheel White' and 'Alba' have white flowers; 'Rubra' and 'Red Clock' have red blooms. Best in cool conditions with well-drained soil. May go dormant in summer.
