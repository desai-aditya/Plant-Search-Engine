Native to the eastern U.S. This is one of those subtly attractive plants you see growing by the roadsideand then ask yourself, I wonder what that is? Grows 23 feet tall and 34 feet wide, with multiple upright stems. Dense clusters of silvery white flowers resembling those of bee balm (Monarda didyma) appear atop the stems by midsummer. Blooms are often spotted with green and pale pink. The silvery coloring extends down from the flowers to include the top 612 inches of the stems and leaves. Foliage has a pleasant minty fragrance; flowers attract bees and butterflies. Carefree plant for  sun or dappled shade, moist  or dry soils. Good candidate for meadows, naturalized areas, woodland edges, even mixed borders.
