Native to moist woodlands  from Virginia to Florida, west  to Louisiana. Open, arching, suckering shrub to 35 feet high and wide. Glossy, bright green leaves to 3 inches long are broadly oval and pointed, reminiscent  of Leucothoe foliage. Clusters  of pale pink, urn-shaped,  inches flowers emerge from leaf axils all along the stems in spring. Rather finickyrequires well-drained, acid soil and will not tolerate drought. Best used in a wood- land garden or naturalized area. 'Morris Minor' is a compact, small-leafed selection.
