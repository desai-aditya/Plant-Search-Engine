Close relatives of coleus; native to many tropical regions of the world. They have square stems, opposite pairs of fleshy, tooth-edged or scalloped leaves, and whorls of tubular, two-lipped blossoms. Some are highly aromatic, used as seasonings or home remedies. Others are grown for their attractive foliage, yet others for their striking floral displays. Some are good bedding plants for summer color; some make dense, weed-suppressing ground covers for frost-protected areas. Several are trailing plants that drape gracefully from hanging baskets or wall pots. All are superb in containers, either alone or in combination with other plants.Easy to grow. Stems take root wherever they touch the ground, and cuttings root quickly in soil or water. Remove flower spikes after they fade. Site houseplants in a bright window, but protect from hottest sun; keep moist, and apply a general-purpose liquid houseplant fertilizer monthly in spring and summer. Stop fertilizing and reduce watering in fall and winter.
