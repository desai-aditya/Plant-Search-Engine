Lush-looking meadow plants that form clumps of finely cut, shiny dark green leaves topped by 2- to 3 feet-tall stems bearing yellow to orange flowers typically shaped like globes or rounded cups. Excellent cut flowers.Remove faded flowers to prolong bloom period. Cannot take drought or extreme heat; constantly damp area near a pond or stream is an ideal planting site. If you are growing globeflowers in a regular garden bed, liberally amend soil with organic matter and keep well watered. Divide clumps only when they thin out in center.
