Native from Florida south to Argentina. To 2 feet high and 5 feet wide, with heavy, brown, creeping rhizomes. Coarse, blue-green fronds drop if hit by frost, but plants recover fast. 'Mandaianum', sometimes called crisped blue fern or lettuce fern, has frilled and wavy frond edges. Both it and the species are showy. Formerly known as Polypodium aureum.
