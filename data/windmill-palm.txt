From China. Medium-size, care- free, very hardy fan palm (to 10F  or lower). Moderate to fast growth to 30 feet high, 10 feet wide. Trunk is usually thicker at top  than at bottom and is covered with dense, blackish fiber; as trunk elongates, fiber falls off its lower portion. Toothed, 112 feet stalks carry 3 feet-wide leaves. Cut off old leaves when they droop and turn yellow. Tolerates some drought and exposure to salt. May look untidy in high winds. Young plants can be grown indoors in good light; plant them outdoors when they become  too big. Cold-hardy selections such as 'Charlotte' and the slightly larger, more vigorous 'Nainital' have survived 5F with little damage.
