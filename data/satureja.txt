These aromatic plants serve many culinary purposes. They're used to flavor sauces, vinegars, stews, soups, meat stuffings, and vegetables. Summer savory has a mild, delicate flavor; winter savory has a strong, pungent taste and retains its intensity when dried. Both are favored by honeybees but ignored by deer.
