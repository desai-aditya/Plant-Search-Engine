From the tropical Americas. Fast-growing plants that are nearly indestructiblecan be grown well even by those who manage to kill everything else. Plants are favored for attractive, leathery, usually glossy leaves. In good conditions, old plants may bloom; flowers resemble those of calla (Zantedeschia), with a boatlike bract surrounding a club-shaped structure. Bracts are usually greenish, white, or reddish. Browsing deer don't seem to care for these plants.Philodendrons fall into two main classes.The following list indicates the class of each species and selection. Note that one popular philodendronthe so-called split-leaf philodendronbelongs to another genus, Monstera.Whether grown in containers or open ground, all philodendrons need rich, loose, well-drained soil. Feed lightly and frequently for good growth and color. Clean dust from leaves of indoor plants. Most philodendronsespecially those grown in containerstend to drop their lower leaves, leaving a bare stem. Once a plant gets gangly and overgrown, the best course is often simply to discard it and replace it with a new plant. However, you can also cut the plant back to short stub, then let it regrow; or you can air-layer the leafy top, then plant the layer once it roots (and discard the parent). Some philodendrons send down aerial roots. Push these into soil or cut them off (removing them won't hurt plant).
