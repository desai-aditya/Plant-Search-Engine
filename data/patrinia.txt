Native to eastern Asia, these easy-to-grow, long-blooming perennials have yet to be discovered by many gardeners. The plants form mounds of deeply cut or lobed leaves that are typically medium green, up to 6 inches long. Nearly leafless blossom stalks rise from the foliage from mid- to late summer; these carry flat-topped clusters of tiny yellow or white flowers that attract butterflies and make a nice addition to both fresh and dried bouquets. Excellent in perennial borders. All appreciate rich, well-drained soil. Fanciers of daylilies (Hemerocallis) should avoid patrinias, however, as they are alternate hosts of daylily rust.
