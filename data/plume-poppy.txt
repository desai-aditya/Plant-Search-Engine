These tall perennials from China and Japan are sometimes still listed as Bocconia, a name properly belonging to their shrubby tropical relatives. The two species described below resemble each other. Both have creeping rhizomes; tall, erect stems; large, deeply lobed leaves much like those of edible fig (Ficus carica); and small flowers in large, branching clusters. These plants have a tropical look, and their value lies in size and structure rather than flower color. Can be invasive if not controlled; plant among shrubs rather than amid delicate perennials. Resist deer.
