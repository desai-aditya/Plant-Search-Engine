Gardeners may think of the sedges as ornamental grasses, but in fact they belong to an entirely different plant family. Found worldwide, they form clumping tufts of gracefully arching, grasslike foliage. The long, narrow evergreen leaves are often striped or oddly colored. Flowers are generally insignificant. Use sedges in borders, contain- ers, rock gardens, and water gardens. Although they are commonly recommended for moist soils, many will grow in relatively dry soils.
