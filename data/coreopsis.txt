Not browsed by deer.All are tough enough for roadside planting. Moderate water.Hybrid annual coreopsis include compact 'Little Penny', which grows less than a foot tall and twice as wide and has small copper-red blooms; the mounding (under a foot high) Punch series in bright shades of red, yellow, orange, and red-and-white bicolors; and the Lemonade series, with feathery golden foliage and red, pink, or rose flowers.
