Hybrid between Japanese fatsia (Fatsia japonica) and English  ivy (Hedera helix), with character- istics of both parents. Highly polished, 4- to 10 inches-wide  leaves with three to five pointed lobes look like giant ivy leaves; plant also sends out long, trailing or climbing stems like ivy,  though without aerial holdfasts. This hybrid inherited shrubbi- ness from its Japanese parent, though its habit is more irreg- ular and sprawling. Leaves of 'Lemon & Lime' ('Annemieke')  are splashed with yellow; those  of 'Variegata' are bordered in white.Leaves are injured at 15F, dies to the ground at 0F, but grows back. Seems to suffer more from late frosts than from winter cold. Give it protection from hot, drying winds. Watch out for slugs and snails. This plant tends to grow in a straight line, but it can be shaped if you work at it. Pinch tip growth to force branching. Two or three times a year, guide and tie stems before they become brittle. If plant gets away from you, cut it back to ground; it will regrow quickly. If you use it as ground cover, cut back vertical growth every 2 or 3 weeks during growing season. Grown as vine or espalier, plants are heavy, so give them strong support. Even a well-grown vine is leafless at base. Deer reistant.
