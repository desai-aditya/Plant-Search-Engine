Native to the eastern U.S. Gets its name from its late-summer fruit, once used as a substitute for hops. Bushy plant grows slowly to 1520 feet tall and wide. Dark green, 2- to 5 inches-long leaves are divided into three oval, pointed leaflets; they turn yellow in fall. Greenish white flowers appear in late spring; they aren't showy,  but the fruit that follows is conspicuousroundish and flattened, to 1 inches across, pale green aging to brown. Easy to grow, very adaptable, and free from serious pests, hop tree is a good candidate for a woodland garden, naturalized area, or even a shrub border. Stems and leaves emit a strong citrus odor when bruised. Leaves of 'Aurea' emerge bright yellow in spring, then fade to lime-green by late summer.
