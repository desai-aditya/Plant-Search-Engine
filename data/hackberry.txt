These big, tough, fast-growing shade trees are similar to elms (Ulmus) but smaller. All have virtue of deep rooting; old trees in narrow planting strips expand in trunk diameter and nearly fill strips without surface roots or any sign of heaving the sidewalk or curb. Good choice for street or lawn tree, even near buildings or paving. Canopy casts moderate shade in spring and summer; leaves turn yellow in fall. Mature trees have picturesque gray bark with corky warts and ridges. Small, berrylike fruit attracts birds.Hackberry is exceptionally durable, taking strong winds (stake young trees until well established); dry heat; and dry, alkaline soils. Bare-root plants, especially in larger sizes, sometimes fail to leaf out. Buy in containers or try for small bare-root trees with big root systems. Wholly optids, which look a bit like snowflakes, can be bothersome pests. They suck sap from the leaves and drip sticky honeydew on everything below. Black mold then grows on the honeydew. This doesn't harm the trees, but it makes a mess. Systemic insecticides applied soon after leaf-out provide control.
