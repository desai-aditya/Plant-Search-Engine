Native to Europe, these creeping perennials spread by surface and underground runners to form low, dense foliage mats. Upright spikes of hooded flowers rise above the leaves in summer. Though names are much con- fused, all species are tough, tolerant, and deep rooted. They are useful for small-scale ground covers and can endure the occasional footstep; set 1 feet apart. Choose location carefully, though: These plants are too invasive to risk near choice, delicate rock garden plants. After bloom, shear off spent flower spikes to keep the planting neat and prevent seed formation.
