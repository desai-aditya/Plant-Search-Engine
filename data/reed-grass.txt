Among the most effective and handsome of ornamental grasses, the reed grasses feature feathery flower plumes that fade from purple-tinted green to yellow to buff. Flowers persist into fall and can be used for fresh or dried arrangements. Cut clumps almost to the ground in late winter, before new growth begins. Deer-resistant.
