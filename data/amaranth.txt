Sometimes coarse weedy plants, but a few ornamental kinds are grown for colorful foliage or flowers. Sow seed in place in early summer; soil temperature must be above 70F for germination. When young and tender, leaves and stems of many species (even some of the weedy ones) can be cooked like spinach in hot weather. Blooms appear in late summer and fall. In some species, seeds look like sesame seeds; they are high in protein and can be used as a grain.
