Stately, symmetrical, fast-growing feather palms. Tall, smooth, gray trunk is marked with rings and topped by a green crown shaft formed by the overlapping frond bases. Hardy to 28F. Do best in moist, well-drained soil. If grown in alkaline soil, they are subject to a disfiguring disease ced frizzle top, caused by a deficiency of manganese or potassium. To prevent this, feed regularly with an 8-4-12 palm fertilizer containing manganese. Have good wind and salt resistance. Resist damage by browsing deer. Can be used as street or avenue trees, to frame large buildings, in groups with other palms. Look especially majestic planted in rows.The Florida royal palm, formerly Roystonea elata, is identical.
