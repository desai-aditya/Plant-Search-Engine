How can something start off so good and end up so bad? is a question that aptly sums up the life of this ornamental pear in the South. Native to China, it rocketed to overwhelming popularity after its flagship selection, 'Bradford,' appeared in the 1960s. It com- bines spectacular spring flowers and fall foliage with a tidy, formal shape and tolerance for heat, drought, compacted soil, and polluted air. Unfortunately,  it wasn't until callery pears festooned practically every highway median, shopping mall parking lot, and suburban front yard that its serious flaws became apparent.Growing 50 feet tall and nearly  as wide with a pyramidal to rounded shape, callery pear is both weedy and savagely thorny. Blooms have a fishy odor. Tuna on a trunk is a good way to describe the situation. When thornless selections like those listed below cross-pollinate, they produce hundreds of mostly thorny seedlings that form impenetrable thickets. Indeed, this tree is now considered an invasive weed in many states. Most selections are prone to fireblight, a disease that blackens leaves and branch tips. 'Capital,' 'Redspire,' and 'White House' are very susceptible; do not plant them.
