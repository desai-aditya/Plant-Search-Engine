Native from Iran to the Himalayas. For fruiting types, see Pomegranate. Plants described here either fail to fruit at all or bear red fruit that is more decorative than tasty. Good landscape plants. Use taller types as foundation plants, in shrub borders, as tall hedges or small trees; lower-growing kinds are excellent for edgings, in containers. All bear showy single or double summer flowers with ruffled petals surrounding a central cluster of stamens. Narrow leaves are bronzy when new, maturing to glossy bright green or golden green; they turn brilliant yellow in fall except where winters are very mild. Take many soil types, including alkaline soil. In  the Middle South, plant against south or west wall. In late dormant season, prune as needed to shape. On shrubby types, remove oldest stems occasionally to encourage strong new growth. Resistant to damage by deer.
