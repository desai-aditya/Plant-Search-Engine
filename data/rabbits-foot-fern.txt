Native to China. This small fern has furry, creeping rhizomes that look something like rabbit's feet. Fronds 810 inches long, very finely cut, rising at intervals from the rhizome. Like squirrel's foot fern (Davallia trichomanoides) in appearance and uses, but slower growing. Can be used as ground cover where it is cold hardy.
