This Eastern European woodland plant grows 112 feet tall and 2 feet wide, with dark green, heart- shaped leaves to 4 inches wide. Airy clusters of tiny, yellow- centered, clear blue flowers reminiscent of forget-me-nots (Myosotis) appear            in spring often into summer, especially in shade. Colored-leaf selections, excellent for brightening shady areas, include 'Diane's Gold', with chartreuse leaves; 'Hadspen Cream', with foliage broadly edged in            creamy white; 'Jack Frost', silver leaves with green margins and veins; 'Langtrees', with silver-spotted foliage; and 'Looking Glass', whose leaves are nearly white. 'Mr. Morse' resembles 'Jack            Frost' but has white flowers.Brunnera is useful as an informal ground cover under high-branching deciduous trees; among spring-flowering shrubs such as forsythia, deciduous magnolias; and as filler between newly planted evergreen shrubs. Freely self-sows once            established. Seeds you plant may not germinate easily (try freezing them before sowing). Needs rich, well-drained, moisture-retentive soil. Increase by dividing clumps in fall.
