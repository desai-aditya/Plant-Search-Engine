One of the tallest grasses, often seen in rural gardens throughout the South. A real conversation piece, thanks to strong, woody stems that can tower to 20 feet or more. Useful as a windbreak, screen, or vertical accent. In most areas, it dies to the ground in winter but regrows quickly in spring. Flat leaves grow to 2 feet long and 3 inches wide. In summer, the plant is crowned by greenish or purplish blooms in showy panicles that grow up to 2 feet long.Spreads quickly by thick rhizomes and can be invasive in moist soil, a quality that has made it a classic passalong plant (it is easy to dig and divide in spring or fall). Seeds can also travel far and wide on the wind, increasing the plant's chances of spreadingso be careful where you plant it, and don't let it escape to the wild. Cut withered stems to the ground in winter; they make good plant stakes.
