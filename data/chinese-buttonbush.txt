This Chinese native looks much like our native buttonbush (Cephalanthus), but it's showier. Fragrant pink flowers that look like little pin cushions appear atop the plant from late spring to late summer. The glossy, bronzy green leaves, similar to those of abelia, persist into late fall. Grows 610 feet tall and wide and needs fertile, acidic, well-drained soil. No serious pests or diseases.
