Among the South's most classic and cherished passalong plants, crinums combine bold, fragrant flowers, imposing foliage, and a bulldog constitution. Seldom seen in newer suburbs, they are now found largely in country gardens, at old home sites, and in cemeteries, where they thrive with little care. Indeed, they tolerate adversity so well that some say no crinum has ever died.Native to many warm and tropical parts of the world; evergreen in the Tropical South, deciduous elsewhere. Each bulb tapers to an elongated, stemlike neck, from which radiate handsome, long, broad, straplike leaves. Rising from the foliage mass are thick stems to 4 feet or taller, each bearing a cluster of long-stalked, lilylike flowers in white, pink, rose red, or reddish purple. Most are 46 inches long; many are highly fragrant. Depending on the type, crinums may flower from spring through late summer; in the Tropical South, some bloom year-round. Can be brought indoors in winter. Not browsed by deer.
