Reliable favorite for summer and fall color in borders and containers. Native to Central America, West Indies. Hairy, soft green leaves are roundish, usually heart shaped at the base. Tiny, tassel-like flowers in blue, white, or pink come in dense clusters that resemble powder puffs. Most floss flowers form foot-wide clumps, but heights vary. Dwarf kinds (46 inches high) with blue flowers include 'Blue Blazer', 'Blue Danube' ('Blue Puffs'), 'Blue Surf', and 'Royal Delft'. Taller (9- to 12 inches.) types include 'Blue Mink', 'North Sea', and Patina Delft. Good selections in other colors are 'Pacific Pink', 'Patina Purple', 'Pink Powder-puffs' and 'Summer Snow', all 912 inches tall. 'Artist Rose' may grow 818 inches tall, and 'Blue Horizon' may reach 12 feet All are best in rich, moist soil. Easy to transplant even when in bloom. Low growers make excellent edgings or pattern plantings with other annuals of similar size. Taller types provide good cut flowers. Seldom browsed by deer.
